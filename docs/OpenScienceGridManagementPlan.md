Open Science Grid Management Plan
=================================

### Introduction

The Open Science Grid (OSG) is a Consortium of institutions and organizations with the goal to design, deploy and operate a shared distributed infrastructure and services in support of US science.

*"The Open Science Grid (OSG) advances science through open distributed computing. The OSG is a multi-disciplinary partnership to federate local, regional, community and national cyberinfrastructures to meet the needs of research and academic communities at all scales."*

An important aspect of OSG is the close collaboration across the scientific user organizations, the resource administrators and the technology providers in all aspects of the program of work. The OSG governing structure consists of two parts: An element which oversees the Open Science Grid as a whole and a set of projects (including satellite projects) with technical leaders managing well defined deliverables towards common goals. The organization of the OSG consists of the fol-lowing:

-   Consortium - all participants.
-   Council - governs the Consortium ensuring effective benefit to the scientific mission of the stakeholders.
-   Scientific Advisory Group - an invited, appointed group representing a diverse scientific community that provides advice to the Council and Executive Team.
-   Executive Team - manages the OSG project and program of work, including the OSG infrastructure, services and software, and oversees the financial arrangements.
-   Executive Board - provides coordination across the areas of work.

This management plan for OSG describes the role and composition of the organizational bodies and the way they interact with the projects. Our goal is to have an organization able to make decisions quickly, clearly and with a common understanding of expectations. We aim to be flexible and to make timely reactions to changes in, or new, user requirements, opportunities and available technologies.

Any group, institution, or organization may join the OSG Consortium by joining in the ongoing program of work. Contributions can be making resources accessible to the infrastructure, use of or providing OSG services and/or software, participating in projects to enhance and/or benefit the OSG. The process is described in more detail in the OSG By-Laws.

The OSG program of work to operate, expand and extend the distributed high throughput computing infrastructure is defined via the governance of the OSG Consortium. The content of this program of work is ultimately owned by the OSG Council and managed by the Executive Director. The effort and funds are organized via a set of projects, which invariably depend on both OSG and externally provided effort and funds. The project deliverables include targeted deliverables to both the Consortium and to the stakeholder organizations.

To extend the capacity and capability of the OSG infrastructure we depend crucially on a mix of effort that is internal and external to the OSG. Internal effort is directly under the fiscal control of the Executive Team. External effort is generally embedded into organizations whose scope extends well beyond the OSG, e.g. the scientific programs of the stakeholder organizations, computer sci-ence groups, as well as the universities and laboratories participating in the OSG Consortium. These contributions are organized as part of the OSG program of work via the set of projects, with the list of projects changing over time.

The OSG staff are mentored both by their local organization and the OSG management. Attention is paid to the technical and professional growth of the staff to enable them to gain and communicate their expertise and foster a productive, improving organization.

### OSG Council

The OSG Council is the governing body of the Consortium responsible for the program of work and ensuring effective benefit to the scientific mission of the stakeholders. The Consortium includes all contributors to OSG and the Council is made of those Consortium members making significant contributions and commitments to the success of OSG. The Council endorses all strategic decisions, which are typically recommended by the Executive Team. The basic rules for operation of the OSG Council are described in the [OSG By-Laws](OpenScienceGridBylaws.md) and summarized here.

The OSG council appoints a Chair following the procedure outlined in the OSG bylaws. The **Council Chair** is an ex-officio member of Executive Board. The Council Chairperson may form a team to assist in the preparation of Council business. The composition of such an advisory group is at the discretion of the Council Chairperson. Council membership includes Institution Representatives selected by the institutions and all members of the Executive Board ex-officio (as non-voting members).

The council elects the Executive Director following the procedures outlined in the OSG bylaws. The Executive Director reports regularly to the OSG Council. Decisions are to be agreed by consensus whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached, the relevant arguments will be documented and distributed to the OSG Council, and a meeting date set to decide the issue. A simple majority of those present who are eligible to vote will decide the issue through an open ballot. In cases where the OSG Council disagrees with a recommendation from the Executive Team the issue, together with a statement of concerns, will be returned to the Executive Team for further discussion. The issue will finally be decided through negotiation between the Executive Team and Council.

The Council elects the Executive Director for 2 years. The Executive Director appoints the Technical Director, the Resources Manager, the Production Coordinator and the Applications Coordinator. The Council confirms all appointees. The Executive Director may appoint co-coordinators and/or deputies in any of these positions. The appointment of a new Executive Director and his/her team takes place 6 months prior to their taking office. Submissions for the post are submitted 2 months before the election. Between the submission and appointment, the Council arranges for presentations by the candidates for Executive Director. During the 6 months following the appointment the new team works with the equivalent members of the current team. If the six month overlap includes any of the months May through July, when planning for the following fiscal year is done, the new ED and team will lead the planning activity. At the transition, the (new) Executive Director and team will be up to speed on all responsibilities and will take over from the previous team at the transition date.

### Scientific Advisory Group

A Scientific Advisory Group consisting of leading scientists provides guidance to the Council. The Scientific Advisory Group reviews the effectiveness of the benefits of OSG to the scientific mission of the stakeholders and provides feedback on the program of work to achieve this. Members of the Scientific Advisory Group are appointed by the Council Chair and confirmed by the Council.

### OSG Project PI and Co-PIs

The OSG Project delivers core services to the goals of the Consortium. The PI is responsible for the contractual obligations to the funding agencies, including the management of funds, reporting and contracts between the OSG Project and the funding agencies. The PI distributes funds through a sub-contract with each institution, as decided by the Executive Director guided by the Resources Manager and Executive Board. The Co-PIs assist the PI in their responsibilities. The PI is a member of the Council and Executive Board. The current organizational structure of the OSG is shown in Figure 2.

### Executive Team

The Executive Director, the Technical Director, the Applications Coordinators, the Associate Executive Director, the Production Coordinator, and the Project Manager form the Executive Team. This team has responsibility and authority for the ongoing program of work of the Project and reporting from the project managers. It supervises and reviews progress covering technical progress, schedule progress, milestones, planning and resources. All strategic Executive Team decisions are submitted to the OSG Council for ratification.

The Executive Team leads the implementation and management of the OSG infrastructure, services and projects. The Executive Team liaises with the contributing projects and follows the evolution, integration, technical and scientific impact of project deliverables and stakeholder needs. The team coordinates and oversees problem solving and encourages development and adoption of common solutions. The team follows the scientific benefit provided by the distributed facility to ensure its effectiveness. The Executive Team monitors closely the performance and operations of the OSG infrastructure.

The organization of projects is communicated through the Executive Team. The Executive Team resolves controversies within or between projects that impact the OSG. The Executive Team is supported by the program office that includes staff for administration, assessment, communications, documentation, education and outreach.
