The organizational structure is depicted in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe OSG Council is the governing body of the Consortium. The OSG Council provides the scientific coordination and oversight of OSG activities. The OSG Council shall self select a chair to lead the council. The term for the Chair shall be two years. Individuals can serve no more than two full consecutive terms as chair.\n\n\nThe Scientific Advisory Group periodically reviews OSG activities and advises the OSG Council on matters related to OSG. The SAG may include leaders of scientific projects using the OSG and leaders in the area of distributed computing. The SAG members are appointed by the OSG Council Chair with input from the Council and the Executive Team.\n\n\nThe OSG Council elects an Executive Director to manage programmatic activities with the help of an Executive Team. The Executive Director appoints an Executive Board to direct the OSG program of work, draw up policies and represent the OSG Consortium in dealing with other organizations and committees.\n\n\nAll appointments to the Executive Board are subject to council approval. Details of the OSG program of work are in the \nOSG Management Plan\n (\nhttp://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=314\n)\n\n\nUsers of and providers to the OSG are not required to be affiliated with OSG member organizations.\n\n\nMembership of the OSG Council\n\n\nMembership in the OSG Consortium does not imply membership on the OSG Council. The OSG council represents the organizations that comprise the OSG Consortium. The Council Membership shall not exceed 30 voting members. At least two voting slots will be held for council members at large to represent OSG Consortium members who do not have direct representation on the council. At large representatives will have a term of two years.\n\n\nOSG Consortium Membership occurs through completed registration of a resource, VO, or other organization with the OSG through the Operations Registration process. OSG Consortium Members contribute to and/or benefit directly from the resources, use, operations and/ or other activities of the OSG.\n\n\nOSG Consortium Partners collaborate with the OSG as peer organizations. Their representatives have ex-officio status on any of the management boards in which they participate. The OSG Executive Board develops agreements with the management of the partner organizations to define the expectations and activities of the collaboration.\n\n\nNew organizations may apply for membership in the OSG council if supported by at least one existing member organization in the OSG council. The proposal for participation is submitted to the OSG Council Chair. The Chair will consult with the Exec Board and the EB will make a recommendation to the Council concerning the application The OSG council formally votes on the acceptance of new member organizations to the Council in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\n\nThe Council has the ability to appoint non-voting liaisons and partnership representatives to participate in the council.\n\n\nAlternates, proxies and attendance requirements\n\n\nIt is the intention that OSG Council members actively participate in Council and Consortium activities on a regular basis. Activities include teleconference, video conferences, face to face meetings, email voting, contributing to the work of the council, etc. A regular basis defined as participation in at least half of the council events a 6 month period.\n\n\nOSG Council members can send alternates to meetings and activities occasionally, but this is not considered actively participating. Alternates are allowed to represent their respective organizations and, if empowered, vote via proxy.\n\n\nOSG Council member can provide a voting proxy to another council member or an alternate by contacting the OSG Council Chair and informing the chair who has the member's proxy. Proxies are temporary and last for the length of a single activity (meeting, electronic vote, etc).\n\n\nFor the sake of votes, 1/5 of the membership is considered a quorum as long as the vote is announced in advanced.\n\n\nMembership in the OSG Executive Board\n\n\nThe OSG Executive Board is comprised of an Executive Director, and Executive Team and other members. The Executive Board directs the OSG program of work and draws up policies. The OSG Executive Board speaks for the OSG consortium and represents the OSG Consortium in dealing with other organizations and committees.\n\n\nEstablishment of bylaws:\n\n\nThe bylaws and \ncharter\n (\nhttp://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=25\n) are accepted by majority vote according the \nOSG Voting Rules\n (\nhttp://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=311\n) as approved at the time of the vote.

            "text": "Open Science Grid Council Voting Procedures\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis document describes the rules by which the council votes on decisions where a formal vote rather than consensus decision is needed.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nDecisions of the OSG Council are made by consensus at any officially convened council meeting whenever possible. Council meetings are officially convened by announcing them via the osg-council list server; topics requiring voting are indicated in the agenda. The OSG Council is composed of representatives of organizations as listed on \nOSG Council Members\n. In this document, the term 'council member' refers to representatives of organizations with full voting privilege on the OSG Council.\n\n\nIf any member of the council challenges a consensus decision within two whole business days (A business day is defined as any days from Monday to Friday, 8 AM Eastern to 5 PM Pacific at the exclusion of US Government Federal Holidays defined by the United States of America, Office of Personnel Management: \nhttp://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/federal-holidays/#url=2013\n) of the posting of the official minutes of the meeting to the council email list then a formal vote will be taken on the decision.\n\n\nA non-meeting voting process will be followed for any decisions which may affect the consortium and its governing structure as a whole. For example, elections of the OSG Executive Director or a vote pertaining to the exclusion of a VO from the consortium are topics which qualify for a non-meeting voting.\n\n\nIn-meeting voting process\n\n\nAny official meeting of the council can have a tallied vote on an issue that was announced seven calendar days in advance of the meeting and included on the agenda. In this case, the council chair may appoint an administrator for the vote as needed.\n\n\nThe vote can consist of a show of hands or roll call, or by other means acceptable to council members present at the meeting. However, it shall always be an open vote where each council member is given an opportunity to reason their decision. The administrator shall ensure that only authorized members of the council or their appointed delegates vote. The count shall be tallied immediately and results announced before the meeting is adjourned. Unless otherwise specified elsewhere, a decision of the council is determined by simple majority of the votes cast, excluding abstentions.\n\n\nNon-meeting voting process\n\n\nThe OSG consortium protects voter's right for privacy.\n\n\n\n\nA formal vote of the council is conducted as an anonymous vote election initiated by Email to the osg-council mailing list. The election will be conducted following one of the technical procedures listed below as the discretion of the election coordinator.\n\n\nFor each election the chair of the council will appoint one member of the council considered to be reasonably impartial with respect the choices to tabulate the vote count and announce the result. This person is the election administrator. The chair may choose to appoint two election administrators to jointly oversee the election if appropriate.\n\n\nNotice of an election is announced by the chair at least 7 calendar days before the start of the voting period. This notice will describe the topic of the election and identify the election administrator(s). In the case of an election caused by challenge to a consensus decision the posting of the meeting minutes starts the 7 day notice period, and the election administrator(s) are announced by the chair at least 24 hours prior to the start of the election period.\n\n\nThe voting period starts when an election administrator posts the ballot notice. The voting period consists of two whole business days following the posting of the ballot notice.\n\n\nIf any council member informs either the chair or an election administrator that he/she is unable to vote by email, he/she can cast his/her vote by telephone conference call with the election administrator(s). Delegation of voting rights by one council member to another or to a delegate should be explicitly mentioned upon opening of the voting period to either the osg-council mailing list or by Email to the election administrator(s).\n\n\nEach organization represented on the council has an equal weight vote. An individual may represent more than one organization, and may thus have more than one vote. In accordance with the delegation principle, a council member may also hold several votes.\n\n\nEach council member shall cast his/her vote(s) once within the voting period. Any votes cast outside of the voting period are considered void.\n\n\nAny individual holding multiple votes shall be allowed to distribute the votes amongst the available choices or direct all votes to one choice.\n\n\nA ballot item is considered approved by the council by a simple majority of votes cast, not counting abstentions. A quorum of at least 1/3rd of voting council member shall be represented for a non-meeting voting to be valid. Supermajority requirements may apply as addressed later.\n\n\nIf a ballot item is multi-valued and no single choice receives a simple majority of votes cast, excluding abstentions, then a new ballot is prepared with only the top two voted choices. In case of tied votes, the ballot consists of the minimum number of tied choices to allow at least two on the ballot.\n\n\nIn case a first round of voting does not result in a decision, the election administrator prepares the revised ballot and sends it to the council email list as part of the result notice of the vote and a second voting period starts. Voting procedures for the second round are the same as for the first round.\n\n\nA tied vote between two choices shall not exceed two consecutive ballots. In such event, a new vote shall be organized at a later time. Addition of new choices or voluntary reduction of existing choices is then allowed.\n\n\nThe election administrators shall announce the results of the election within one whole business day of the close of the voting period.\n\n\n\n\nSupermajority requirements\n\n\nInstances requiring a supermajority are subsets of in-meeting or non-meeting voting regulations. Supermajority requirements are used for reaching decisions of broad impact or extreme importance to the consortium, its direction or structure.\n\n\nOSG executive director election\n\n\nThe OSG executive director election will follow a non-meeting procedure and a minimal quorum of 60% of the voting pool will be required to validate the ballot.\n\n\nBylaws modification\n\n\nImportant restructuring and modifications of the OSG bylaws requires a vote following an absolute majority voting to ensure affirmative support for the proposal.\n\n\nSuspension of membership\n\n\nCouncil Member Organizations may transition from voting to non-voting membership and vice versa. Those cases are handled via the membership rules of the Council. Membership suspension requires a 2/3rd majority vote of an in meeting vote of the council. The period of suspension is to be stipulated as part of the issue being voted on. The council member who is subject to this vote is permitted to vote on this issue but is not required to be present at the meeting. A valid reason for the suspension must be included as part of the voting procedure and the reason must be agreed upon by the Executive Director, Council chair and two additional members of the Executive Board. The reason must be based upon credible evidence that the council member is materially interfering with or damaging the mission of Open Science Grid.\n\n\nAnnouncing results\n\n\nAfter the voting period is concluded and all votes are counted the election administrator(s) will send a notice of the decisions on each ballot item to the council email list, the chair of the council, and a CC to the other election administrator.\n\n\nChallenging results\n\n\nAny three members of the council or the executive board can challenge the results of an election. In case of a challenge, the chair shall appoint two people to audit the results, who are not the people challenging the results or the original election administrators. The two auditors and the chair shall together review all pertinent materials, provided by the election administrators or other means. The results of the audit shall be announced by the chair within two calendar weeks of the challenge.\n\n\nAppendix - Technical Procedures\n\n\nAll announcements and notices of an incoming election are posted to the council email list, \nosg-council@opensciencegrid.org\n. The method by which the election is carried remains at the discretion of the election administrator(s). The above notes provide two balloting models:\n\n\nEmail balloting\n\n\nFormat of the ballot\n\n\nThe ballot shall include the list of names of all those persons permitted to vote, and the organizations they represent.\n\n\nThe ballot shall include a clear description of each item for which a vote is needed, and clearly identify each choice for the item.\n\n\nThe ballot shall indicate how a vote for a particular choice should be marked.\n\n\nPosting the ballot\n\n\nAn election administrator sends the ballot as an email message to the council email list with a CC to the second election administrator if applicable. Casting a vote Each voting member of the council shall cast their vote by replying to the email message containing the ballot and indicating their choice(s) appropriately, as described in the ballot.\n\n\nCounting votes\n\n\nAll election administrators shall independently verify that all received ballots are from only authorized voting council members, tally the results, and verify that their tallies agree. Any cast ballots received from non-authorized persons shall be discarded.\n\n\nOnly cast ballots received within the voting period shall be counted. The election administrators shall guarantee that the clocks on the computers where they receive email are accurate to within 15 minutes and accept cast ballots within 15 minutes outside the time window of the voting period.\n\n\nIn case that more selected choices are indicated on a ballot item than allowed for that item, the vote on that item on the cast ballot is considered invalid.\n\n\nFor ballots requiring a YES/NO answer, a ballot choice marked with an ambiguous value such as OK or XX rather than YES, shall be taken to mean YES. If a ballot choice allows a negative vote, only a clear value such as NO or NOT will be counted as negative.\n\n\nIn the case of two election administrators, both shall independently count all the ballots and compare their results at the conclusion of the voting period. They will work together to resolve any discrepancies.\n\n\nE-Polling ballot\n\n\nFormat of the ballot\n\n\nThe ballot shall include a clear description of each item for which a vote is needed, and clearly identify each choice for the item. The ballot choices shall be self-explanatory as per how a vote for a particular choice; selection box should be coupled with text.\n\n\nPosting the ballot\n\n\nOne of the election administrators, with CC to the second election administrator, sends to the council mailing list a list of names of voting council members and their Email address. Within one business day, individual Emails are sent to the council members indicating the location and access method of the ballot (a URL reference and password). Each individual Email shall be sent to both election administrators.\n\n\nCasting a vote and tabulation\n\n\nEach voting member of the council shall cast their vote by following the provided instructions contained in the Email message, as described in the ballot. The poll shall be opened only once to each voting member.\n\n\nThe poll shall be closed for access after the voting period has expired. The election administrators shall guarantee and verify that the clock on the polling-computer is accurate to within 15 minutes and accept cast ballots within 15 minutes outside the time window of the voting period. When the poll is closed, the results should be accessible to all council members.\n\n\nChange History\n\n\nV1, Nov. 28, 2006, JL, Approved by council 11/28/2006 moved to version 1.0\n\n\nV0.5 Jan.1, 2006, fkw, Fixed 2 minor things that got overlooked.\n\n\nV0.4 Dec. 31, 2005, fkw, Integrated Albert comments and misc. suggestions.

A formal vote of the council is conducted as an anonymous vote election initiated by Email to the osg-council mailing list. The election will be conducted following one of the technical procedures listed below as the discretion of the election coordinator.  For each election the chair of the council will appoint one member of the council considered to be reasonably impartial with respect the choices to tabulate the vote count and announce the result. This person is the election administrator. The chair may choose to appoint two election administrators to jointly oversee the election if appropriate.  Notice of an election is announced by the chair at least 7 calendar days before the start of the voting period. This notice will describe the topic of the election and identify the election administrator(s). In the case of an election caused by challenge to a consensus decision the posting of the meeting minutes starts the 7 day notice period, and the election administrator(s) are announced by the chair at least 24 hours prior to the start of the election period.  The voting period starts when an election administrator posts the ballot notice. The voting period consists of two whole business days following the posting of the ballot notice.  If any council member informs either the chair or an election administrator that he/she is unable to vote by email, he/she can cast his/her vote by telephone conference call with the election administrator(s). Delegation of voting rights by one council member to another or to a delegate should be explicitly mentioned upon opening of the voting period to either the osg-council mailing list or by Email to the election administrator(s).  Each organization represented on the council has an equal weight vote. An individual may represent more than one organization, and may thus have more than one vote. In accordance with the delegation principle, a council member may also hold several votes.  Each council member shall cast his/her vote(s) once within the voting period. Any votes cast outside of the voting period are considered void.  Any individual holding multiple votes shall be allowed to distribute the votes amongst the available choices or direct all votes to one choice.  A ballot item is considered approved by the council by a simple majority of votes cast, not counting abstentions. A quorum of at least 1/3rd of voting council member shall be represented for a non-meeting voting to be valid. Supermajority requirements may apply as addressed later.  If a ballot item is multi-valued and no single choice receives a simple majority of votes cast, excluding abstentions, then a new ballot is prepared with only the top two voted choices. In case of tied votes, the ballot consists of the minimum number of tied choices to allow at least two on the ballot.  In case a first round of voting does not result in a decision, the election administrator prepares the revised ballot and sends it to the council email list as part of the result notice of the vote and a second voting period starts. Voting procedures for the second round are the same as for the first round.  A tied vote between two choices shall not exceed two consecutive ballots. In such event, a new vote shall be organized at a later time. Addition of new choices or voluntary reduction of existing choices is then allowed.

            "text": "Open Science Grid Management Plan\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe Open Science Grid (OSG) is a Consortium of institutions and organizations with the goal to design, deploy and operate a shared distributed infrastructure and services in support of US science.\n\n\n\"The Open Science Grid (OSG) advances science through open distributed computing. The OSG is a multi-disciplinary partnership to federate local, regional, community and national cyberinfrastructures to meet the needs of research and academic communities at all scales.\"\n\n\nAn important aspect of OSG is the close collaboration across the scientific user organizations, the resource administrators and the technology providers in all aspects of the program of work. The OSG governing structure consists of two parts: An element which oversees the Open Science Grid as a whole and a set of projects (including satellite projects) with technical leaders managing well defined deliverables towards common goals. The organization of the OSG consists of the fol-lowing:\n\n\n\n\nConsortium - all participants.\n\n\nCouncil - governs the Consortium ensuring effective benefit to the scientific mission of the stakeholders.\n\n\nScientific Advisory Group - an invited, appointed group representing a diverse scientific community that provides advice to the Council and Executive Team.\n\n\nExecutive Team - manages the OSG project and program of work, including the OSG infrastructure, services and software, and oversees the financial arrangements.\n\n\nExecutive Board - provides coordination across the areas of work.\n\n\n\n\nThis management plan for OSG describes the role and composition of the organizational bodies and the way they interact with the projects. Our goal is to have an organization able to make decisions quickly, clearly and with a common understanding of expectations. We aim to be flexible and to make timely reactions to changes in, or new, user requirements, opportunities and available technologies.\n\n\nAny group, institution, or organization may join the OSG Consortium by joining in the ongoing program of work. Contributions can be making resources accessible to the infrastructure, use of or providing OSG services and/or software, participating in projects to enhance and/or benefit the OSG. The process is described in more detail in the OSG By-Laws.\n\n\nThe OSG program of work to operate, expand and extend the distributed high throughput computing infrastructure is defined via the governance of the OSG Consortium. The content of this program of work is ultimately owned by the OSG Council and managed by the Executive Director. The effort and funds are organized via a set of projects, which invariably depend on both OSG and externally provided effort and funds. The project deliverables include targeted deliverables to both the Consortium and to the stakeholder organizations.\n\n\n\n\nTo extend the capacity and capability of the OSG infrastructure we depend crucially on a mix of effort that is internal and external to the OSG. Internal effort is directly under the fiscal control of the Executive Team. External effort is generally embedded into organizations whose scope extends well beyond the OSG, e.g. the scientific programs of the stakeholder organizations, computer sci-ence groups, as well as the universities and laboratories participating in the OSG Consortium. These contributions are organized as part of the OSG program of work via the set of projects, with the list of projects changing over time.\n\n\nThe OSG staff are mentored both by their local organization and the OSG management. Attention is paid to the technical and professional growth of the staff to enable them to gain and communicate their expertise and foster a productive, improving organization.\n\n\nOSG Council\n\n\nThe OSG Council is the governing body of the Consortium responsible for the program of work and ensuring effective benefit to the scientific mission of the stakeholders. The Consortium includes all contributors to OSG and the Council is made of those Consortium members making significant contributions and commitments to the success of OSG. The Council endorses all strategic decisions, which are typically recommended by the Executive Team. The basic rules for operation of the OSG Council are described in the \nOSG By-Laws\n and summarized here.\n\n\nThe OSG council appoints a Chair following the procedure outlined in the OSG bylaws. The \nCouncil Chair\n is an ex-officio member of Executive Board. The Council Chairperson may form a team to assist in the preparation of Council business. The composition of such an advisory group is at the discretion of the Council Chairperson. Council membership includes Institution Representatives selected by the institutions and all members of the Executive Board ex-officio (as non-voting members).\n\n\nThe council elects the Executive Director following the procedures outlined in the OSG bylaws. The Executive Director reports regularly to the OSG Council. Decisions are to be agreed by consensus whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached, the relevant arguments will be documented and distributed to the OSG Council, and a meeting date set to decide the issue. A simple majority of those present who are eligible to vote will decide the issue through an open ballot. In cases where the OSG Council disagrees with a recommendation from the Executive Team the issue, together with a statement of concerns, will be returned to the Executive Team for further discussion. The issue will finally be decided through negotiation between the Executive Team and Council.\n\n\nThe Council elects the Executive Director for 2 years. The Executive Director appoints the Technical Director, the Resources Manager, the Production Coordinator and the Applications Coordinator. The Council confirms all appointees. The Executive Director may appoint co-coordinators and/or deputies in any of these positions. The appointment of a new Executive Director and his/her team takes place 6 months prior to their taking office. Submissions for the post are submitted 2 months before the election. Between the submission and appointment, the Council arranges for presentations by the candidates for Executive Director. During the 6 months following the appointment the new team works with the equivalent members of the current team. If the six month overlap includes any of the months May through July, when planning for the following fiscal year is done, the new ED and team will lead the planning activity. At the transition, the (new) Executive Director and team will be up to speed on all responsibilities and will take over from the previous team at the transition date.\n\n\nScientific Advisory Group\n\n\nA Scientific Advisory Group consisting of leading scientists provides guidance to the Council. The Scientific Advisory Group reviews the effectiveness of the benefits of OSG to the scientific mission of the stakeholders and provides feedback on the program of work to achieve this. Members of the Scientific Advisory Group are appointed by the Council Chair and confirmed by the Council.\n\n\nOSG Project PI and Co-PIs\n\n\nThe OSG Project delivers core services to the goals of the Consortium. The PI is responsible for the contractual obligations to the funding agencies, including the management of funds, reporting and contracts between the OSG Project and the funding agencies. The PI distributes funds through a sub-contract with each institution, as decided by the Executive Director guided by the Resources Manager and Executive Board. The Co-PIs assist the PI in their responsibilities. The PI is a member of the Council and Executive Board. The current organizational structure of the OSG is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Team\n\n\nThe Executive Director, the Technical Director, the Applications Coordinators, the Associate Executive Director, the Production Coordinator, and the Project Manager form the Executive Team. This team has responsibility and authority for the ongoing program of work of the Project and reporting from the project managers. It supervises and reviews progress covering technical progress, schedule progress, milestones, planning and resources. All strategic Executive Team decisions are submitted to the OSG Council for ratification.\n\n\nThe Executive Team leads the implementation and management of the OSG infrastructure, services and projects. The Executive Team liaises with the contributing projects and follows the evolution, integration, technical and scientific impact of project deliverables and stakeholder needs. The team coordinates and oversees problem solving and encourages development and adoption of common solutions. The team follows the scientific benefit provided by the distributed facility to ensure its effectiveness. The Executive Team monitors closely the performance and operations of the OSG infrastructure.\n\n\nThe organization of projects is communicated through the Executive Team. The Executive Team resolves controversies within or between projects that impact the OSG. The Executive Team is supported by the program office that includes staff for administration, assessment, communications, documentation, education and outreach.\n\n\nExecutive Director\n\n\nThe OSG Executive Director chairs the OSG Executive Team and the Executive Board. The Ex-ecutive Director matches the program of work to the scientific needs of the stakeholders from the OSG. The Executive Director leads the external relations and outreach parts of the OSG project, communicating between with OSG and external bodies and partners. The Executive Director, together with the Executive Team, decides on staff resource allocations across the projects. He/she runs periodic reviews of operations efficiencies and delivery of resources to the stakeholders. Decisions are reached by consensus wherever possible. The Executive Director may propose a compromise statement to try to reach consensus. If none is reached, the Executive Director may take an operational decision on immediate issues but shall forward the issue to the OSG Council for final decision.\n\n\nTechnical Director\n\n\nThe Technical Director manages the technical and software capabilities and evolution of the OSG program of work. The Technical Director leads the Technology Group that is responsible for the architecture and blueprint of the software, software tools and functionality of the OSG. He/she is responsible for overseeing the quality and evolution of the technical aspects of the program of work.\n\n\nAssociate Executive Director\n\n\nThe OSG Associate Executive Director acts as the liaison to the associated projects, such as Institutes, that make needed contributions to the scope of work of the OSG project. The Associate Executive Director is a member of the Executive Team. The Associate Executive Director ensures effective communication of the (technical, schedule, process) requirements of OSG and its stakeholders to the associated projects, agreement and delivery of the contributions from the associated projects, and ensure an effective matching of the ongoing program of work to the scientific needs of the stakeholders from the OSG.\n\n\nApplications Coordinators\n\n\nThe Applications Coordinators provide ongoing technical input to and assessment of the project deliverables for the applications and advise the rest of the Executive Team on the program of work and its effectiveness in contributing to the scientific missions.\n\n\nProduction Coordinator\n\n\nThe Production Coordinator oversees the production usage, operations, and on-campus activities of the OSG. The Production Coordinator tracks production usage and follows up on short-term problems and issues identified. He/she identifies, extracts, and socializes best practices as they are identified and coordinates these with the community to execute best practices in a manner that minimizes disruptions in the productivity. The production coordinator brings computing and storage resource needs to the Executive Team for discussion and forwarding as needed to the Council (whose members contribute the resources). The Operations and Campus leads report to the Production Coordinator:\n\n\n\n\nThe Operations Lead coordinates the monitoring and support and operates the OSG infra-structure.\n\n\nThe Campus Lead coordinates the extension of the production services into the campuses.\n\n\n\n\nProject Manager\n\n\nThe Project Manager defines and tracks the deliverables, milestones, costs and resources of the OSG program of work. The Project Manager defines and tracks the annual program of work and the day-to-day deliverables and schedule of the program. He/she tracks and recommends the dis-tribution of costs and effort. The Project Manager coordinates reporting of the Projects as they im-pact the OSG.\n\n\nExecutive Board\n\n\nThe Executive Board plans, decides, and executes the detailed program of work of the project. The Executive Board consists of the Executive Team, the Resources Manager, the Area Leads and the Council Co-Chairs (Ex-officio). The area leads are responsible for the deliverables and services in their technical area of work and also the interfaces between OSG and their users. The Area Leads are Security, Software, Campus, Operations, User Support, and Technology.\n\n\nResources Manager\n\n\nThe Resources Manager oversees the finances within the OSG, as well as the contributions from external organizations. The Executive Team discusses and decides on issues related to OSG fi-nances - including funding, distribution of charges, income and expenditure. The Executive Team, Executive Board, or stakeholder organizations can make requests for a change in the financial allocations to the Resources Manager. The Resources Manager is a member of the Executive Board.\n\n\nSoftware Infrastructure\n\n\nThe Software Infrastructure Lead coordinates the packaging, distribution and support of the OSG infrastructure middleware. Particular responsibilities include: making timely releases of the OSG middleware in response to project and stakeholder requirements; testing and validation of the integrated set of components in the OSG middleware releases; coordinating support for the OSG middleware; determining the effectiveness of the OSG middleware to the scientific benefit to the Consortium stakeholders. The software infrastructure lead also leads the Software Tools Group that oversees the development and delivery of all software tools and utilities owned by the OSG. OSG staff writes (and supports) or acquires, utilities and tools to provide new capabilities to the infrastructure in support of the program of work. The Software Coordinator is a member of the Executive Board.\n\n\nSecurity Officer\n\n\nThe Security Officer coordinates, monitors and supports the security of the OSG infrastructure. Par-ticular responsibilities include: providing and operating the operational security processes of the distributed facility; identifying and communicating security threats and vulnerabilities; coordinating the response to and mitigation of security threats, vulnerabilities and incidents; overseeing the trust, authentication and authorization infrastructure.

Particular responsibilities include: identifying target groups and organizing collaborative work; liaising between the OSG applications, extension development projects, and the user communities; coordinating the support for integration and/or interoperation of new users and new approaches with the existing teams and activities. The User Support group runs task forces or 'campaigns' targeted to increase the effectiveness of and benefit from OSG for a particular community. The User Support Coordinator is a member of the Executive Board.\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\nThe Technical Director works with the Technology Lead to document the current high-level architecture, articulate the end-to-end design of the Open Science Grid software distribution, create a roadmap of future functional and performance goals of the OSG software system, and assist the area teams in having a coherent, consistent end-to-end system. The Technology Investigations Coordinator assesses technology changes and new capabilities as requested by the stakeholders. The Technology Group and Investigations Coordinators are members of the Executive Board.\n\n\nProjects and Satellites\n\n\nProjects are the organizational means by which deliverables that OSG depends on are defined, agreed to, executed and delivered. . Each project is managed by a project management team, and may be funded completely through the Consortium, include contributions both from within and external to the OSG, or be completely externally funded. Projects are \nSatellites\n (\nhttps://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/OSGSatelliteProjects\n) if OSG was involved in the planning process, OSG commits support for future collaborative action and if the project agrees to be considered an OSG Satellite project.\n\n\nChanges to this Management Plan\n\n\nChanges to this management plan are proposed by the Council or Executive Director in consultation with the Executive Team and approved by both bodies.\n\n\nStanding Meetings\n\n\nThe following standing meetings are part of the OSG management.

            "text": "The Open Science Grid (OSG) is a Consortium of institutions and organizations with the goal to design, deploy and operate a shared distributed infrastructure and services in support of US science.  \"The Open Science Grid (OSG) advances science through open distributed computing. The OSG is a multi-disciplinary partnership to federate local, regional, community and national cyberinfrastructures to meet the needs of research and academic communities at all scales.\"  An important aspect of OSG is the close collaboration across the scientific user organizations, the resource administrators and the technology providers in all aspects of the program of work. The OSG governing structure consists of two parts: An element which oversees the Open Science Grid as a whole and a set of projects (including satellite projects) with technical leaders managing well defined deliverables towards common goals. The organization of the OSG consists of the fol-lowing:   Consortium - all participants.  Council - governs the Consortium ensuring effective benefit to the scientific mission of the stakeholders.  Scientific Advisory Group - an invited, appointed group representing a diverse scientific community that provides advice to the Council and Executive Team.  Executive Team - manages the OSG project and program of work, including the OSG infrastructure, services and software, and oversees the financial arrangements.  Executive Board - provides coordination across the areas of work.   This management plan for OSG describes the role and composition of the organizational bodies and the way they interact with the projects. Our goal is to have an organization able to make decisions quickly, clearly and with a common understanding of expectations. We aim to be flexible and to make timely reactions to changes in, or new, user requirements, opportunities and available technologies.  Any group, institution, or organization may join the OSG Consortium by joining in the ongoing program of work. Contributions can be making resources accessible to the infrastructure, use of or providing OSG services and/or software, participating in projects to enhance and/or benefit the OSG. The process is described in more detail in the OSG By-Laws.  The OSG program of work to operate, expand and extend the distributed high throughput computing infrastructure is defined via the governance of the OSG Consortium. The content of this program of work is ultimately owned by the OSG Council and managed by the Executive Director. The effort and funds are organized via a set of projects, which invariably depend on both OSG and externally provided effort and funds. The project deliverables include targeted deliverables to both the Consortium and to the stakeholder organizations.   To extend the capacity and capability of the OSG infrastructure we depend crucially on a mix of effort that is internal and external to the OSG. Internal effort is directly under the fiscal control of the Executive Team. External effort is generally embedded into organizations whose scope extends well beyond the OSG, e.g. the scientific programs of the stakeholder organizations, computer sci-ence groups, as well as the universities and laboratories participating in the OSG Consortium. These contributions are organized as part of the OSG program of work via the set of projects, with the list of projects changing over time.  The OSG staff are mentored both by their local organization and the OSG management. Attention is paid to the technical and professional growth of the staff to enable them to gain and communicate their expertise and foster a productive, improving organization.",

            "text": "The OSG Council is the governing body of the Consortium responsible for the program of work and ensuring effective benefit to the scientific mission of the stakeholders. The Consortium includes all contributors to OSG and the Council is made of those Consortium members making significant contributions and commitments to the success of OSG. The Council endorses all strategic decisions, which are typically recommended by the Executive Team. The basic rules for operation of the OSG Council are described in the  OSG By-Laws  and summarized here.  The OSG council appoints a Chair following the procedure outlined in the OSG bylaws. The  Council Chair  is an ex-officio member of Executive Board. The Council Chairperson may form a team to assist in the preparation of Council business. The composition of such an advisory group is at the discretion of the Council Chairperson. Council membership includes Institution Representatives selected by the institutions and all members of the Executive Board ex-officio (as non-voting members).  The council elects the Executive Director following the procedures outlined in the OSG bylaws. The Executive Director reports regularly to the OSG Council. Decisions are to be agreed by consensus whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached, the relevant arguments will be documented and distributed to the OSG Council, and a meeting date set to decide the issue. A simple majority of those present who are eligible to vote will decide the issue through an open ballot. In cases where the OSG Council disagrees with a recommendation from the Executive Team the issue, together with a statement of concerns, will be returned to the Executive Team for further discussion. The issue will finally be decided through negotiation between the Executive Team and Council.  The Council elects the Executive Director for 2 years. The Executive Director appoints the Technical Director, the Resources Manager, the Production Coordinator and the Applications Coordinator. The Council confirms all appointees. The Executive Director may appoint co-coordinators and/or deputies in any of these positions. The appointment of a new Executive Director and his/her team takes place 6 months prior to their taking office. Submissions for the post are submitted 2 months before the election. Between the submission and appointment, the Council arranges for presentations by the candidates for Executive Director. During the 6 months following the appointment the new team works with the equivalent members of the current team. If the six month overlap includes any of the months May through July, when planning for the following fiscal year is done, the new ED and team will lead the planning activity. At the transition, the (new) Executive Director and team will be up to speed on all responsibilities and will take over from the previous team at the transition date.",

Members include owners of resources and technology projects, as well as science research and education user groups and communities, and organizations partnering with the OSG. Members of the OSG include both Organizations (Facilities, DOE Labs, Universities etc) and Virtual Organizations (or Science Communities, Software Projects etc.)\n\n\nMembers of the OSG are either directly represented on the governing Council or through the Collective VO Representatives on the Council.\n\n\nOfficial representation of the OSG, including the point of contact for the funding agencies, is through the Executive Director, as described in the OSG Project Cooperative Agreement. The Project PI is responsible for the contractual obligations to the funding agencies. Of course, members of the OSG may contact or work with any other member, OSG staff or contributor. Any member of the OSG may discuss the OSG with anyone, but official representation of OSG (with external projects, organizations and agencies etc) remains through the Executive Director or their designee.\n\n\nMember Expectations of the OSG\n\n\nAny member of the OSG can expect to use resources made accessible through the OSG subject to the Policies of the resource owner. The fraction of resources available to non-owners are made through agreement with the Council. The existing members of the OSG Council have agreed to keep their resources configured such that if they are not being otherwise used other OSG communities can use them. \"ie opportunistically\". Any member of the OSG can expect to determine the availability of resources (enumerated, description and capacity) accessible through the OSG from the Information Services (available at...). The services available to for a member to use are available through an enumerated list of the core services (available at...).\n\n\nAny member of the OSG may use, receive support for, and make additional requests of software components available from the OSG VDT. New components will be provided based on the assessment of the Software Coordinator and project Executive Team. Support will be provided as possible constrained by the effort and knowledge available.\n\n\nAny member of the OSG can expect to receive attention to their end-to-end distributed computing goals and needs. They can expect to receive intellectual input to help with their system architecture, design and implementation decisions. They can expect to receive help through the OSG operations and support staff when they have problems or questions.\n\n\nA VO should determine the support lines for end users within that VO. In general, the VO provides the first line of support for their end users. They work with the OSG to determine if the part for support is \"End User -> VO -> OSG staff\" or the End User will receive support from the OSG staff directly.\n\n\nOSG Expectations of Members\n\n\nMembers must comply with the appropriate policies and usage agreements of the OSG.\n\n\nMembers should be willing to communicate and share their accomplishments based on use of the OSG services with the OSG for the purposes of annual reports, newsletters, iSGTW and other publications. Members must report publications that benefited from OSG services to the Council.\n\n\nMembers should\n\n\n\n\nEndorse the mission and vision of the OSG and be interested to contribute to its mutually beneficial support and progress.\n\n\nSupport the evolution and innovation of the OSG through helping identify the need for or provide via new collaborations, technologies and practices.\n\n\nProvide, support or use some of the common services, and also help improve and evolve those services for the common good.\n\n\nHelp sustain the community good through intellectual investment, contribution of time and effort, and common current and future interest.\n\n\n\n\nNew Member Expectations and Process\n\n\nEach new member of the OSG registers appropriately through the Operations Center, Virtual Organization, or OSG management body.\n\n\nEnd users register with a Virtual Organization (VO). If a new end user is not part of a community registered already registered with the OSG, they can contact the Operations Center for help finding an appropriate VO with whom they can register, that can be an OSG owned VO such as Engagement, a general VO such as GLOW, or community specific VO such as SBGrid or LIGO.\n\n\nThe first line of support is by the VO management and support organizations, and/or support center.\n\n\nEach new Site or Resource member receives initial help through the Operations Team in addition to their VO.\n\n\nEach new member, as well as new end users registered with OSG owned VOs (see below), receives help through User Support which can last up to several months to help them derive benefit from the OSG services. Help is given in one or more of:\n\n\n\n\nproviding an understanding of how to use the distributed infrastructure;\n\n\nadapting applications to run effectively on OSG sites;\n\n\nengaging in the deployment of community owned distributed infrastructures;\n\n\nproduction and VO group staff support to ensure the needs of the new community are met;\n\n\nproviding common tools and services\n\n\nworking directly with and in support of the new end users with the goal to have them transition to be full contributing members of the OSG.\n\n\n\n\nUser Support is a broad activity within the OSG. To enable effective support given constrained effort available, the engagement of a new member is done by one of several mechanisms. The operations and ET teams ensure that as part of the registration process a potential end user or new member is successfully placed in the right channel for help and support.\n\n\n\n\nThe OSG Engage VO manager at RENCI.\n\n\nThe OSG Production and VO Group leaders who support members who will shortly be or already are communities with sufficient effort to support their own VO management and support services.\n\n\nThe OSG VO manager - the Executive Director.\n\n\nThe OSG Edu(cation) VO\n\n\nOSG effort co-located with a community VOs such as GLOW, centered at University of Wisconsin Madison, SBGrid, structural biology grid at HMS, DOSAR Universities, HCC a the University of Nebraska etc.\n\n\nExisting OSG members and communities.",

They can expect to receive help through the OSG operations and support staff when they have problems or questions.  A VO should determine the support lines for end users within that VO. In general, the VO provides the first line of support for their end users. They work with the OSG to determine if the part for support is \"End User -> VO -> OSG staff\" or the End User will receive support from the OSG staff directly.",

End users register with a Virtual Organization (VO). If a new end user is not part of a community registered already registered with the OSG, they can contact the Operations Center for help finding an appropriate VO with whom they can register, that can be an OSG owned VO such as Engagement, a general VO such as GLOW, or community specific VO such as SBGrid or LIGO.  The first line of support is by the VO management and support organizations, and/or support center.  Each new Site or Resource member receives initial help through the Operations Team in addition to their VO.  Each new member, as well as new end users registered with OSG owned VOs (see below), receives help through User Support which can last up to several months to help them derive benefit from the OSG services. Help is given in one or more of:   providing an understanding of how to use the distributed infrastructure;  adapting applications to run effectively on OSG sites;  engaging in the deployment of community owned distributed infrastructures;  production and VO group staff support to ensure the needs of the new community are met;  providing common tools and services  working directly with and in support of the new end users with the goal to have them transition to be full contributing members of the OSG.   User Support is a broad activity within the OSG. To enable effective support given constrained effort available, the engagement of a new member is done by one of several mechanisms. The operations and ET teams ensure that as part of the registration process a potential end user or new member is successfully placed in the right channel for help and support.
