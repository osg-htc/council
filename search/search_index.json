A Member of the OSG is 'registered' through the OSG management interfaces and processes (often provided by the Operations team). Members include owners of resources and technology projects, as well as science research and education user groups and communities, and organizations partnering with the OSG. Members of the OSG include both Organizations (Facilities, DOE Labs, Universities etc) and Virtual Organizations (or Science Communities, Software Projects etc.) Members of the OSG are either directly represented on the governing Council or through the Collective VO Representatives on the Council. Official representation of the OSG, including the point of contact for the funding agencies, is through the Executive Director, as described in the OSG Project Cooperative Agreement. The Project PI is responsible for the contractual obligations to the funding agencies. Of course, members of the OSG may contact or work with any other member, OSG staff or contributor. Any member of the OSG may discuss the OSG with anyone, but official representation of OSG (with external projects, organizations and agencies etc) remains through the Executive Director or their designee. Member Expectations of the OSG Any member of the OSG can expect to use resources made accessible through the OSG subject to the Policies of the resource owner. The fraction of resources available to non-owners are made through agreement with the Council. The existing members of the OSG Council have agreed to keep their resources configured such that if they are not being otherwise used other OSG communities can use them. \"ie opportunistically\". Any member of the OSG can expect to determine the availability of resources (enumerated, description and capacity) accessible through the OSG from the Information Services (available at...). The services available to for a member to use are available through an enumerated list of the core services (available at...). Any member of the OSG may use, receive support for, and make additional requests of software components available from the OSG VDT. New components will be provided based on the assessment of the Software Coordinator and project Executive Team. Support will be provided as possible constrained by the effort and knowledge available. Any member of the OSG can expect to receive attention to their end-to-end distributed computing goals and needs. They can expect to receive intellectual input to help with their system architecture, design and implementation decisions. They can expect to receive help through the OSG operations and support staff when they have problems or questions. A VO should determine the support lines for end users within that VO. In general, the VO provides the first line of support for their end users. They work with the OSG to determine if the part for support is \"End User -> VO -> OSG staff\" or the End User will receive support from the OSG staff directly. OSG Expectations of Members Members must comply with the appropriate policies and usage agreements of the OSG. Members should be willing to communicate and share their accomplishments based on use of the OSG services with the OSG for the purposes of annual reports, newsletters, iSGTW and other publications. Members must report publications that benefited from OSG services to the Council. Members should Endorse the mission and vision of the OSG and be interested to contribute to its mutually beneficial support and progress. Support the evolution and innovation of the OSG through helping identify the need for or provide via new collaborations, technologies and practices. Provide, support or use some of the common services, and also help improve and evolve those services for the common good. Help sustain the community good through intellectual investment, contribution of time and effort, and common current and future interest. New Member Expectations and Process Each new member of the OSG registers appropriately through the Operations Center, Virtual Organization, or OSG management body. End users register with a Virtual Organization (VO). If a new end user is not part of a community registered already registered with the OSG, they can contact the Operations Center for help finding an appropriate VO with whom they can register, that can be an OSG owned VO such as Engagement, a general VO such as GLOW, or community specific VO such as SBGrid or LIGO. The first line of support is by the VO management and support organizations, and/or support center. Each new Site or Resource member receives initial help through the Operations Team in addition to their VO. Each new member, as well as new end users registered with OSG owned VOs (see below), receives help through User Support which can last up to several months to help them derive benefit from the OSG services. Help is given in one or more of: providing an understanding of how to use the distributed infrastructure; adapting applications to run effectively on OSG sites; engaging in the deployment of community owned distributed infrastructures; production and VO group staff support to ensure the needs of the new community are met; providing common tools and services working directly with and in support of the new end users with the goal to have them transition to be full contributing members of the OSG. User Support is a broad activity within the OSG. To enable effective support given constrained effort available, the engagement of a new member is done by one of several mechanisms. The operations and ET teams ensure that as part of the registration process a potential end user or new member is successfully placed in the right channel for help and support. The OSG Engage VO manager at RENCI. The OSG Production and VO Group leaders who support members who will shortly be or already are communities with sufficient effort to support their own VO management and support services.

Help is given in one or more of: providing an understanding of how to use the distributed infrastructure; adapting applications to run effectively on OSG sites; engaging in the deployment of community owned distributed infrastructures; production and VO group staff support to ensure the needs of the new community are met; providing common tools and services working directly with and in support of the new end users with the goal to have them transition to be full contributing members of the OSG. User Support is a broad activity within the OSG. To enable effective support given constrained effort available, the engagement of a new member is done by one of several mechanisms. The operations and ET teams ensure that as part of the registration process a potential end user or new member is successfully placed in the right channel for help and support. The OSG Engage VO manager at RENCI. The OSG Production and VO Group leaders who support members who will shortly be or already are communities with sufficient effort to support their own VO management and support services.

Organizational Structure of the Open Science Consortium The governing bodies of the OSG Consortium are the OSG Council and the OSG Executive Board. The organizational structure is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. The OSG Council is the governing body of the Consortium. The OSG Council provides the scientific coordination and oversight of OSG activities. The OSG Council shall self select a chair to lead the council. The term for the Chair shall be two years. Individuals can serve no more than two full consecutive terms as chair. The Scientific Advisory Group periodically reviews OSG activities and advises the OSG Council on matters related to OSG. The SAG may include leaders of scientific projects using the OSG and leaders in the area of distributed computing. The SAG members are appointed by the OSG Council Chair with input from the Council and the Executive Team. The OSG Council elects an Executive Director to manage programmatic activities with the help of an Executive Team. The Executive Director appoints an Executive Board to direct the OSG program of work, draw up policies and represent the OSG Consortium in dealing with other organizations and committees. All appointments to the Executive Board are subject to council approval.

Membership of the OSG Council Membership in the OSG Consortium does not imply membership on the OSG Council. The OSG council represents the organizations that comprise the OSG Consortium. The Council Membership shall not exceed 30 voting members. At least two voting slots will be held for council members at large to represent OSG Consortium members who do not have direct representation on the council. At large representatives will have a term of two years. OSG Consortium Membership occurs through completed registration of a resource, VO, or other organization with the OSG through the Operations Registration process. OSG Consortium Members contribute to and/or benefit directly from the resources, use, operations and/ or other activities of the OSG. OSG Consortium Partners collaborate with the OSG as peer organizations. Their representatives have ex-officio status on any of the management boards in which they participate. The OSG Executive Board develops agreements with the management of the partner organizations to define the expectations and activities of the collaboration. New organizations may apply for membership in the OSG council if supported by at least one existing member organization in the OSG council. The proposal for participation is submitted to the OSG Council Chair. The Chair will consult with the Exec Board and the EB will make a recommendation to the Council concerning the application The OSG council formally votes on the acceptance of new member organizations to the Council in a timely and appropriate manner. The Council has the ability to appoint non-voting liaisons and partnership representatives to participate in the council. Alternates, proxies and attendance requirements It is the intention that OSG Council members actively participate in Council and Consortium activities on a regular basis. Activities include teleconference, video conferences, face to face meetings, email voting, contributing to the work of the council, etc. A regular basis defined as participation in at least half of the council events a 6 month period. OSG Council members can send alternates to meetings and activities occasionally, but this is not considered actively participating. Alternates are allowed to represent their respective organizations and, if empowered, vote via proxy.

Introduction Decisions of the OSG Council are made by consensus at any officially convened council meeting whenever possible. Council meetings are officially convened by announcing them via the osg-council list server; topics requiring voting are indicated in the agenda. The OSG Council is composed of representatives of organizations as listed on OSG Council Members . In this document, the term 'council member' refers to representatives of organizations with full voting privilege on the OSG Council. If any member of the council challenges a consensus decision within two whole business days (A business day is defined as any days from Monday to Friday, 8 AM Eastern to 5 PM Pacific at the exclusion of US Government Federal Holidays defined by the United States of America, Office of Personnel Management: http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/federal-holidays/#url=2013 ) of the posting of the official minutes of the meeting to the council email list then a formal vote will be taken on the decision. A non-meeting voting process will be followed for any decisions which may affect the consortium and its governing structure as a whole. For example, elections of the OSG Executive Director or a vote pertaining to the exclusion of a VO from the consortium are topics which qualify for a non-meeting voting. In-meeting voting process Any official meeting of the council can have a tallied vote on an issue that was announced seven calendar days in advance of the meeting and included on the agenda. In this case, the council chair may appoint an administrator for the vote as needed. The vote can consist of a show of hands or roll call, or by other means acceptable to council members present at the meeting. However, it shall always be an open vote where each council member is given an opportunity to reason their decision. The administrator shall ensure that only authorized members of the council or their appointed delegates vote. The count shall be tallied immediately and results announced before the meeting is adjourned. Unless otherwise specified elsewhere, a decision of the council is determined by simple majority of the votes cast, excluding abstentions. Non-meeting voting process The OSG consortium protects voter's right for privacy. A formal vote of the council is conducted as an anonymous vote election initiated by Email to the osg-council mailing list. The election will be conducted following one of the technical procedures listed below as the discretion of the election coordinator. For each election the chair of the council will appoint one member of the council considered to be reasonably impartial with respect the choices to tabulate the vote count and announce the result. This person is the election administrator. The chair may choose to appoint two election administrators to jointly oversee the election if appropriate. Notice of an election is announced by the chair at least 7 calendar days before the start of the voting period. This notice will describe the topic of the election and identify the election administrator(s). In the case of an election caused by challenge to a consensus decision the posting of the meeting minutes starts the 7 day notice period, and the election administrator(s) are announced by the chair at least 24 hours prior to the start of the election period. The voting period starts when an election administrator posts the ballot notice. The voting period consists of two whole business days following the posting of the ballot notice. If any council member informs either the chair or an election administrator that he/she is unable to vote by email, he/she can cast his/her vote by telephone conference call with the election administrator(s). Delegation of voting rights by one council member to another or to a delegate should be explicitly mentioned upon opening of the voting period to either the osg-council mailing list or by Email to the election administrator(s). Each organization represented on the council has an equal weight vote. An individual may represent more than one organization, and may thus have more than one vote. In accordance with the delegation principle, a council member may also hold several votes. Each council member shall cast his/her vote(s) once within the voting period. Any votes cast outside of the voting period are considered void. Any individual holding multiple votes shall be allowed to distribute the votes amongst the available choices or direct all votes to one choice. A ballot item is considered approved by the council by a simple majority of votes cast, not counting abstentions. A quorum of at least 1/3rd of voting council member shall be represented for a non-meeting voting to be valid. Supermajority requirements may apply as addressed later. If a ballot item is multi-valued and no single choice receives a simple majority of votes cast, excluding abstentions, then a new ballot is prepared with only the top two voted choices. In case of tied votes, the ballot consists of the minimum number of tied choices to allow at least two on the ballot. In case a first round of voting does not result in a decision, the election administrator prepares the revised ballot and sends it to the council email list as part of the result notice of the vote and a second voting period starts. Voting procedures for the second round are the same as for the first round. A tied vote between two choices shall not exceed two consecutive ballots. In such event, a new vote shall be organized at a later time. Addition of new choices or voluntary reduction of existing choices is then allowed. The election administrators shall announce the results of the election within one whole business day of the close of the voting period. Supermajority requirements Instances requiring a supermajority are subsets of in-meeting or non-meeting voting regulations. Supermajority requirements are used for reaching decisions of broad impact or extreme importance to the consortium, its direction or structure. OSG executive director election The OSG executive director election will follow a non-meeting procedure and a minimal quorum of 60% of the voting pool will be required to validate the ballot. Bylaws modification Important restructuring and modifications of the OSG bylaws requires a vote following an absolute majority voting to ensure affirmative support for the proposal. Suspension of membership Council Member Organizations may transition from voting to non-voting membership and vice versa. Those cases are handled via the membership rules of the Council. Membership suspension requires a 2/3rd majority vote of an in meeting vote of the council. The period of suspension is to be stipulated as part of the issue being voted on. The council member who is subject to this vote is permitted to vote on this issue but is not required to be present at the meeting. A valid reason for the suspension must be included as part of the voting procedure and the reason must be agreed upon by the Executive Director, Council chair and two additional members of the Executive Board. The reason must be based upon credible evidence that the council member is materially interfering with or damaging the mission of Open Science Grid. Announcing results After the voting period is concluded and all votes are counted the election administrator(s) will send a notice of the decisions on each ballot item to the council email list, the chair of the council, and a CC to the other election administrator. Challenging results Any three members of the council or the executive board can challenge the results of an election. In case of a challenge, the chair shall appoint two people to audit the results, who are not the people challenging the results or the original election administrators. The two auditors and the chair shall together review all pertinent materials, provided by the election administrators or other means. The results of the audit shall be announced by the chair within two calendar weeks of the challenge. Appendix - Technical Procedures All announcements and notices of an incoming election are posted to the council email list, osg-council@opensciencegrid.org . The method by which the election is carried remains at the discretion of the election administrator(s). The above notes provide two balloting models: Email balloting Format of the ballot The ballot shall include the list of names of all those persons permitted to vote, and the organizations they represent. The ballot shall include a clear description of each item for which a vote is needed, and clearly identify each choice for the item. The ballot shall indicate how a vote for a particular choice should be marked. Posting the ballot An election administrator sends the ballot as an email message to the council email list with a CC to the second election administrator if applicable. Casting a vote Each voting member of the council shall cast their vote by replying to the email message containing the ballot and indicating their choice(s) appropriately, as described in the ballot. Counting votes All election administrators shall independently verify that all received ballots are from only authorized voting council members, tally the results, and verify that their tallies agree. Any cast ballots received from non-authorized persons shall be discarded. Only cast ballots received within the voting period shall be counted. The election administrators shall guarantee that the clocks on the computers where they receive email are accurate to within 15 minutes and accept cast ballots within 15 minutes outside the time window of the voting period. In case that more selected choices are indicated on a ballot item than allowed for that item, the vote on that item on the cast ballot is considered invalid. For ballots requiring a YES/NO answer, a ballot choice marked with an ambiguous value such as OK or XX rather than YES, shall be taken to mean YES. If a ballot choice allows a negative vote, only a clear value such as NO or NOT will be counted as negative. In the case of two election administrators, both shall independently count all the ballots and compare their results at the conclusion of the voting period. They will work together to resolve any discrepancies. E-Polling ballot Format of the ballot The ballot shall include a clear description of each item for which a vote is needed, and clearly identify each choice for the item. The ballot choices shall be self-explanatory as per how a vote for a particular choice; selection box should be coupled with text. Posting the ballot One of the election administrators, with CC to the second election administrator, sends to the council mailing list a list of names of voting council members and their Email address. Within one business day, individual Emails are sent to the council members indicating the location and access method of the ballot (a URL reference and password). Each individual Email shall be sent to both election administrators. Casting a vote and tabulation Each voting member of the council shall cast their vote by following the provided instructions contained in the Email message, as described in the ballot. The poll shall be opened only once to each voting member. The poll shall be closed for access after the voting period has expired. The election administrators shall guarantee and verify that the clock on the polling-computer is accurate to within 15 minutes and accept cast ballots within 15 minutes outside the time window of the voting period. When the poll is closed, the results should be accessible to all council members.

Each organization represented on the council has an equal weight vote. An individual may represent more than one organization, and may thus have more than one vote. In accordance with the delegation principle, a council member may also hold several votes. Each council member shall cast his/her vote(s) once within the voting period. Any votes cast outside of the voting period are considered void. Any individual holding multiple votes shall be allowed to distribute the votes amongst the available choices or direct all votes to one choice. A ballot item is considered approved by the council by a simple majority of votes cast, not counting abstentions. A quorum of at least 1/3rd of voting council member shall be represented for a non-meeting voting to be valid. Supermajority requirements may apply as addressed later. If a ballot item is multi-valued and no single choice receives a simple majority of votes cast, excluding abstentions, then a new ballot is prepared with only the top two voted choices. In case of tied votes, the ballot consists of the minimum number of tied choices to allow at least two on the ballot. In case a first round of voting does not result in a decision, the election administrator prepares the revised ballot and sends it to the council email list as part of the result notice of the vote and a second voting period starts. Voting procedures for the second round are the same as for the first round. A tied vote between two choices shall not exceed two consecutive ballots. In such event, a new vote shall be organized at a later time. Addition of new choices or voluntary reduction of existing choices is then allowed. The election administrators shall announce the results of the election within one whole business day of the close of the voting period.","title":"Non-meeting voting process"},{"location":"OpenScienceGridConsortiumVotingProcedures/#supermajority-requirements","text":"Instances requiring a supermajority are subsets of in-meeting or non-meeting voting regulations.

The OSG is a multi-disciplinary partnership to federate local, regional, community and national cyberinfrastructures to meet the needs of research and academic communities at all scales.\" An important aspect of OSG is the close collaboration across the scientific user organizations, the resource administrators and the technology providers in all aspects of the program of work. The OSG governing structure consists of two parts: An element which oversees the Open Science Grid as a whole and a set of projects (including satellite projects) with technical leaders managing well defined deliverables towards common goals. The organization of the OSG consists of the fol-lowing: Consortium - all participants. Council - governs the Consortium ensuring effective benefit to the scientific mission of the stakeholders. Scientific Advisory Group - an invited, appointed group representing a diverse scientific community that provides advice to the Council and Executive Team. Executive Team - manages the OSG project and program of work, including the OSG infrastructure, services and software, and oversees the financial arrangements. Executive Board - provides coordination across the areas of work. This management plan for OSG describes the role and composition of the organizational bodies and the way they interact with the projects. Our goal is to have an organization able to make decisions quickly, clearly and with a common understanding of expectations. We aim to be flexible and to make timely reactions to changes in, or new, user requirements, opportunities and available technologies. Any group, institution, or organization may join the OSG Consortium by joining in the ongoing program of work. Contributions can be making resources accessible to the infrastructure, use of or providing OSG services and/or software, participating in projects to enhance and/or benefit the OSG. The process is described in more detail in the OSG By-Laws. The OSG program of work to operate, expand and extend the distributed high throughput computing infrastructure is defined via the governance of the OSG Consortium. The content of this program of work is ultimately owned by the OSG Council and managed by the Executive Director. The effort and funds are organized via a set of projects, which invariably depend on both OSG and externally provided effort and funds. The project deliverables include targeted deliverables to both the Consortium and to the stakeholder organizations. To extend the capacity and capability of the OSG infrastructure we depend crucially on a mix of effort that is internal and external to the OSG. Internal effort is directly under the fiscal control of the Executive Team. External effort is generally embedded into organizations whose scope extends well beyond the OSG, e.g. the scientific programs of the stakeholder organizations, computer sci-ence groups, as well as the universities and laboratories participating in the OSG Consortium. These contributions are organized as part of the OSG program of work via the set of projects, with the list of projects changing over time. The OSG staff are mentored both by their local organization and the OSG management. Attention is paid to the technical and professional growth of the staff to enable them to gain and communicate their expertise and foster a productive, improving organization. OSG Council The OSG Council is the governing body of the Consortium responsible for the program of work and ensuring effective benefit to the scientific mission of the stakeholders. The Consortium includes all contributors to OSG and the Council is made of those Consortium members making significant contributions and commitments to the success of OSG. The Council endorses all strategic decisions, which are typically recommended by the Executive Team. The basic rules for operation of the OSG Council are described in the OSG By-Laws and summarized here. The OSG council appoints a Chair following the procedure outlined in the OSG bylaws. The Council Chair is an ex-officio member of Executive Board. The Council Chairperson may form a team to assist in the preparation of Council business. The composition of such an advisory group is at the discretion of the Council Chairperson. Council membership includes Institution Representatives selected by the institutions and all members of the Executive Board ex-officio (as non-voting members). The council elects the Executive Director following the procedures outlined in the OSG bylaws. The Executive Director reports regularly to the OSG Council. Decisions are to be agreed by consensus whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached, the relevant arguments will be documented and distributed to the OSG Council, and a meeting date set to decide the issue. A simple majority of those present who are eligible to vote will decide the issue through an open ballot. In cases where the OSG Council disagrees with a recommendation from the Executive Team the issue, together with a statement of concerns, will be returned to the Executive Team for further discussion. The issue will finally be decided through negotiation between the Executive Team and Council. The Council elects the Executive Director for 2 years. The Executive Director appoints the Technical Director, the Resources Manager, the Production Coordinator and the Applications Coordinator. The Council confirms all appointees. The Executive Director may appoint co-coordinators and/or deputies in any of these positions. The appointment of a new Executive Director and his/her team takes place 6 months prior to their taking office. Submissions for the post are submitted 2 months before the election. Between the submission and appointment, the Council arranges for presentations by the candidates for Executive Director. During the 6 months following the appointment the new team works with the equivalent members of the current team. If the six month overlap includes any of the months May through July, when planning for the following fiscal year is done, the new ED and team will lead the planning activity. At the transition, the (new) Executive Director and team will be up to speed on all responsibilities and will take over from the previous team at the transition date. Scientific Advisory Group A Scientific Advisory Group consisting of leading scientists provides guidance to the Council. The Scientific Advisory Group reviews the effectiveness of the benefits of OSG to the scientific mission of the stakeholders and provides feedback on the program of work to achieve this. Members of the Scientific Advisory Group are appointed by the Council Chair and confirmed by the Council. OSG Project PI and Co-PIs The OSG Project delivers core services to the goals of the Consortium. The PI is responsible for the contractual obligations to the funding agencies, including the management of funds, reporting and contracts between the OSG Project and the funding agencies. The PI distributes funds through a sub-contract with each institution, as decided by the Executive Director guided by the Resources Manager and Executive Board. The Co-PIs assist the PI in their responsibilities. The PI is a member of the Council and Executive Board. The current organizational structure of the OSG is shown in Figure 2. Executive Team The Executive Director, the Technical Director, the Applications Coordinators, the Associate Executive Director, the Production Coordinator, and the Project Manager form the Executive Team.

Organizational Structure The governing bodies of the OSG Consortium are the OSG Council and the OSG Executive Team (the organizational structure is detailed in the OSG management plan ). The OSG Council provides the scientific coordination and oversight of OSG activities. The Council Chairpersons are self-elected by the Council to lead the Council. The Executive Director is elected by the Council to manage programmatic activities with the help of an Executive Team. The Executive Team is appointed by the Executive Director to direct the OSG program of work (details of the program of work may be found in the OSG Management Plan ), draw up policies and represent the OSG Consortium in dealing with other organizations and committees. All appointments to the Executive Team are subject to Council approval. Note: Users of OSG services and providers of capacity to the Open Science Compute and Data Federations do not need to be affiliated with OSG member organizations. Membership of the OSG Consortium Consortium membership occurs through completed registration of a resource, VO, or other organization with the Consortium through an operations registration process. Consortium members contribute to and/or benefit directly from the resources, use, operations, and/or other activities. Consortium members recognize that the OSG fabric of services is a sharing ecosystem and strive to maximize the sharing of computing resources, software, and other assets to enable science. Consortium partners collaborate with the Consortium as peer organizations. Their representatives have ex-officio status on any of the management boards in which they participate. The Executive Team develops agreements with the management of the partner organizations to define the expectations and activities of the collaboration. Membership of the Council Membership in the OSG Consortium does not imply membership on the OSG Council. The Council represents the organizations that comprise the Consortium. The Council membership shall not exceed 30 voting members. At least two voting slots will be held for Council members-at-large to represent Consortium members who do not have direct representation on the Council. At-large representatives will have a term of 2 years. The Council has the ability to appoint non-voting liaisons and partnership representatives to participate in the Council. New organizations may apply for membership in the Council if supported by at least one existing member. The proposal for participation is submitted to the Council Chair. The Chair will consult with the Executive Team who will make a recommendation to the Council concerning the application. The Council formally votes on the acceptance of new members in a timely and appropriate manner. Council Chairpersons At any given time, there shall be two Council Chairpersons, either a Chair (Acting) and a Chair-Elect, or a Chair (Acting) and a Past Chair. Every 2 years, the Council shall self-elect a Chair-Elect, who will serve 1 year in that role before becoming Chair for the following 2 years. Upon the ascension of the Chair-Elect to Chair, the preceding Chair serves as Past Chair for 1 year, ending when the subsequent Chair-Elect is elected. The accompanying diagram illustrates the scheme. Provisions for a sustainable and resilient model are as follows: Should the Chair be unable to complete the 2-year term, the Chair-Elect will immediately become Chair and the Council will select a new Chair-Elect. The Council will adjust the election cycle so that the new Chair serves a 2-year effective term (\u201cacting\u201d role). Should the Chair-Elect be unable to complete the 1-year term, the Council will select a new Chair-Elect. This could happen during either (a) the overlap with an outgoing Chairperson serving as backup - in this case, an elect is found and immediately serves as acting Chair under the guidance of the outgoing Chairperson, or (b) immediately after the election of a Chair-elect has occurred \u2013 in this case, a new Chair-elect is elected. In this later case, the Council Chairperson may also call the Council to endorse the second-best alternate candidate of the recent election. Should neither the Chair nor the Chair-Elect be able to complete their terms, the OSG Executive Director will temporarily serve as Council Chair for the purpose of organizing the selection of a new Chair and Chair-Elect. Council member responsibilities It is the intention that OSG Council members actively participate in Council and Consortium activities on a regular basis. Activities include teleconference, video-conferences, face-to-face meetings, email voting, contributing to the work of the Council, etc. A regular basis is defined as participation in at least half of the Council events during a 6-month period. Alternates Council members can send alternates to meetings and activities occasionally, but this is not considered actively participating. Alternates are allowed to represent their respective organizations and, if empowered, vote via proxy. Quorum For the sake of votes, 1/5 of the membership is considered a quorum as long as the vote is announced in advance. A Council member can provide a voting proxy to another Council member or an alternate by contacting the Council Chair and informing the Chair who has the member\u2019s proxy. Proxies are temporary and last for the length of a single activity (meeting, electronic vote, etc.). Establishment of Bylaws The bylaws and charter are accepted by majority vote according to the OSG Voting Procedures as approved at the time of the vote. The initial bylaws and charter were accepted by consensus. Amendment of Bylaws or Charter An amendment to the bylaws or charter can be proposed by any member of the Executive Team or Council. A proposed amendment is then accepted according the OSG Voting Rules as approved at the time of the vote.
