---+++ Agenda/Minutes:

   * *CompBioGrid:*
      * The CompBioGrid has mostly been involved with prototyping and testing work. Their original ideal was to enable a large user community of biologist for computational biology (typically see about 70 active users a month with a much larger community of users that drop in and out over a several month time frame). At the time of formation, they felt they had sufficient resources to support the community at start-up, but expected sufficient growth to quickly out pace planned resource expansion. They reviewed what was available to get involved with and found that OSG looked like the best match for their VO. They have several dedicated clusters at University of Conn under the School of Medicine. They are primarily focused on simulations involving interactions between cells. They just received funding last fall, which in part, has allowed them to pursue OSG related activities. They are currently setting up an OSG CE for prototyping and development using resources from one of the UConn clusters; would also like to deploy an OSG SE in the near future. They have a "rich" client that is web based and allows them to hide complexity from their user community. This client has been developed for their  local resources and they are looking into extending it to use the OSG. They have found that porting their applications is a bit involved and details really must be hidden from their community of users. The client interacts with a back-end server, which handle bundling up the job for submission onto worker nodes. Some of their prototyping has been in collaboration with UCSD. They are finding management of user certificates, and especially propagation of credentials through there client-server-gridsite environment challenging and will probably seek advise from the OSG on how best to do this at some point. They are aware that others have a similar model in the OSG. One of the challenges they discovered when first attempting to do grid job submission outside their own resources was that the UConn connectivity to the outside  world was a bandwidth bottleneck for their applications and data movement needs. They are now setting up their own link directly to Internet2 to solve the bandwidth issues for grid computing. They hope to have everything working and ready for a broader community of users in the month of July. Most of their prototyping activities on the OSG have been through the effort of two members of their VO. To a large extent early activities were "pathfinder" in nature, identifying the number of sites on the OSG that were open to their VO and identifying bandwidth and storage limitations. They expect to need some assistance as they move into a production model with making their applications appear transparent to their user community. This will primarily involve working with CompBioGrid administrators that were responsible for providing the tools (clients) to the user community to assure the transparency and no so much provide support to a community of application developers under their VO. It is still a bit early to know all the details, this list of areas they would like help with was given based on what has been experienced so far:
         * Automation of job submission
         * Using grid certificates
         * Challenging their site resources by other VOs (NOTE: They hope to work with Ian Stokes-Rees in this area)
         * Finally, CompBioGrid expressed an interest in attending more of these types of meetings in the future. It appears that they are looking for a forum for expressing their VO needs and requirements, sharing experiences and learning how other VOs have address similar goals and challenges - User Group Meetings would be good for this!

   * *Feedback from question to all that were still on the call at the end: "Do you feel the current design for having two "at-large" VOs with seats on the council for two year terms would meet the needs of your VO?*
      * When the current Council By-Laws were presented, Ion felt that the near term needs of his VO would be met by the model of having two "at-large" representatives on the council but asked how this would or could evolve into the future.
      * What are the policies for evolving the major stakeholders, what makes a VO a major stakeholder. Is there a procedure for evolving the standing seats on the council?
