---++ SBGRID Background Documentation

---+++ The following is an extended version of the February OSG Newsletter on SBGrid

SBGrid is a consortium of 100 Structural Biology labs across the   country.  The central SBGrid team, based at Harvard Medical   School, provides an integrated computing environment with hundreds   of specialty software packages available for a range of platforms   (Linux, OS X, and SGI).  Over the past year SBGrid has become   increasingly involved with Open Science Grid both through the   provision of two compute clusters, available to all VOs, and in   the development of novel workflows for computationally intensive   protein structure determination.  Structural biology is a critical   field at the boundary of biology, physics, and chemistry, studying   the bio-mechanics of cellular processes mediated by proteins at an   atomic level resolution. Current techniques to determine the   physical geometry (conformation) of protein structures is time   consuming, possibly taking many person-months to complete.  SBGrid   is developing techniques that will automate the process and will   include information from the existing database of 50,000   macromolecular structures. This has relied on replication of the   corpus of 150,000 known macromolecular domains, requiring 40 GB of   persisted storage space, to all OSG sites used by the workflow.  A   challenging aspect is collating and presenting the resulting data,   which, for a single study, consists of tens of thousands of files   and approximately 3 GB of data.  Web-based data visualization has   been developed to facilitate this step.

Since the start of the   year SBGrid has utilized over 10,000 hours of compute time on   remote OSG compute resources, running more than 5,000 jobs.
In process of deploying its current work-flows SBGrid has   established a significant grid expertise and will now also lead   the regional effort in Boston area to expand affiliations with the   Open Science Grid. The SBGrid Computing School scheduled for May   6-8, 2009 (http://school.sbgrid.org), will host a special OSG   session and participants will be able to enroll in one of three   specialized computing workshops (data animation, OSX programming   and Scientific Python).

---+++ Noteworthy

%BLUE% *minutes:*

Motions to select both Piotr Sliz (SBGrid) and Shaowen Wang (Collective VO) as new voting representative of the council were presented. Both motions were approved.

It was recommended by the council that OSG Executive Team engage LIGO with a follow on face-to-face meeting.

Ruth Pordes presented the new OSG Organizational Chart to the Council for adoption. A motion was made to have the council endorse the new OSG Org Chart and was successfully carried.

Ruth Pordes presented on the new program for student fellowship. A motion was made to have the council endorse the fellowship program. The motion was successfully carried.

There was a recommendation, after much discussion of the challenges the OSG has faced with storage solutions for the past several years, that aa face-to-face meeting on storage take place in June and should last for two days. The meeting should include stakeholder participation.

The council heard reports from the subcommittees. It was noted that the two subcommittees had reached different opinions regarding the inclusion of detailed language on the selection of members on the council as outlined in "recommendation 1" of the "At-Large VO" subcommittee. A motion to dismiss the "recommendation 1" from the "At-Large VO" subcommittee in favor of having the collective VOs self organize and interface with the Council through the two "Collective VO" representatives (previously known as at-large VOs) was made before the council. The council agreed via the approval of the motion to dismiss "recommendation 1" from the At-Large VO Subcommittee.

There were recommendations for the At Large VO group:
   * Cap the number of task forces to <10
   * Cap the length of time of a task force to 3-4 months.

There was a discussion of the approach of OSG to MPI jobs and to understand the market place for such jobs and whether OSG is an appropriate infrastructure to support them. The discussion ranged from 100-1000 node MPI to 32-64 node MPI. The latter will fit in a "single box".

There was considerable discussion on understanding how to move forward with the funding agencies. It was recommended that a core group of representatives from the OSG arrange to visit both the NSF and DOE to develop an understanding for what is possible as we plan for the future, including the stimulus package possibilities.

Noted that for MRIs, which are expected to be available through the stimulus package, that a 30% matching fund was required.

The Executive Team agreed to present a proposed scope of the future of the OSG for the next face to face Council meeting. The Executive Director was instructed to arrange visits to the funding agencies for such discussions, before the next face to face Council meeting. 

Discussed the venue for our next Council Face-to-Face meeting. The dates of August 10th and 11th as two one-half days of meeting in the Chicago O'Hare area was proposed. Kent will forward this to the council for further feedback.
