---++Action Items: 

*PKI Transition project* 

DECISION: The Council accepts the OSG PKI Contingency plan presented by Mine. The plan makes sufficient progress so to make further work on the plan lower priority than other PKI Transition tasks. Apart from Action Items identified, further work on the Contingency Plan can be delayed until following completion of the PKI Transition. Subsequent Notes should be addressed when subsequent work on the plan commences. 

1. ACTION ITEM for Mine: OSG Security team to present OSG PKI Contingency plans to WLCG. 

NOTES: The council noted the following improvements, which should be made to the contingency plan in a subsequent version:

1. Identify order of magnitude for total effort for specific response to compromise of DigiCert. Chander request. 

2. Is this team aware of any other enterprise that has actually implemented contingency steps in worst case event — have Europeans done this? -Chander question

3. Better estimates regarding cost, ongoing maintenance contingency plans.

4. Analyze what’s most expensive after an incident vs. before and analyze this now as part of contingency planning/ recovery planning. 

5. Find out how long does it take to get each user a new certificate for CERN CA?

6. Include in diagrams/ communication piece the plan for worst case scenario. 

7. Present a plan and reason for temporary variance to existing policy versus high cost, time consuming mitigation to set up IGTF service.
