---+++ OSG as an XSEDE Service Provider - Ruth Pordes
Dan answered Piotr questions re: the usefulness for Peter Doherty to become a member of Campus Champions.

Miron cautioned not to equate XSEDE with XD.

XSEDE made commitment to have a service provider forum by end of 1st Quarter of project – October.

For communications, Miriam is talking to Bill Bell of NCSA.

Allocations committee, Chandar and Dan jointly participating.

Miron seeks an allocation committee, who to give cycles to? “Not a resource problem, a consumption problem”
Keep discussing issue of allocation.

Questions: Expanding the umbrella of XD, will it work, be in OSG best interest? Ruth-Should we also learn how CF21 relates, interfaces and if it is different from XD? (XD has funding CF 21 under a different umbrella-Miron) How can OSG participate in these meetings as OSG? Make it a legal entity? RP to follow up with Piotr and Dan. Ruth-Advanced user support communities vs. projects- what’s the difference? Want to be clear on Purdue resource- making it clear in Kim’s mind when dealing w/ individuals wanting to use resources, when is it appropriate to vector people to OSG? What does Campus Bridge actually do? How much of OSG’s human resources can we allocate to establish policies on allocating opportunistic resources? What is the expectation XSEDE has w/ OSG, allow people in as opportunistic or allow in as op. w/ some limit? Ruth-When are we likely to need more resources?- Go to funding agencies, replicate this pressure.
