---+++ Officers Reports:

      * Council Representation: Jarek Nabrzyski of Notre Dame has indicated his interested in increased engagement of ND with OSG at the Consortium/Council level.  Notre Dame has a condor campus infrastructure flocking with Purdue, has an OSG site, and is a leading institution for the dV/DT and DASPOS satellites. I am interested in your input for this. Jarek plans to come to the AHM in March and is available to present to the Council at the face to face there.
         * ND VO  is a Campus Grid; positive response from David S. and Bill B.: this “will broaden representation of Council and provide additional non-physics representation.”
      * EGI and XSEDE plan a workshop on use cases across CIs at the upcoming EGI community forum in April http://cf2013.egi.eu/ . OSG applications would seem to be an exemplar here and I am looking for one or two volunteers to help with a joint submission.
         * Propose to have a single OSG submission- on applications running across EGI,  now and in future, 1 physics, 1 non-physics.
         * Projects meeting qualifications:  include SB Grid and ENMR community; SuperB; Baker lab use of OSG under Engage or OSG VO; DZero; for LHC – have some sentences and point to results.
      * Status of [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Council/CouncilActionItems][Action Items]]  - Ruth 
         * 88. Follow up on user support lead for SURAgrid for Guy Almes and Steve Johnson - Chander. *Outcome* "It doesn't appear that we'll (..SuraGrid will) be able to get past the 3 constraints to running glideinWMS across all of the SURAgrid sites, so we'll continue to pursue traditional and perhaps new methods for workflow management. "  “We offered to review these issues with them in greater detail but they did not feel that would be productive- we let it go at that point. They will continue with their own methods”.-Chander
         * 86 and 85: CIC and Campus Grids discussions will happen this month
         * 82: Follow up re: GlueX:  “GlueX didn’t have initial production requirements but  have ramped up usage within last week. Currently averaging over 100K per day in past few days (140K in past three). Usage will be monitored and if problems arise, we’ll address.”-Chander
      * BES Community Reports to the Council- Amber Boehnlein, Michael Ernst
      * Annual OSG All Hands meeting

         * Derek reports CI is engaging users via Condor user’s mailing list also going to outside community.. Pablo from Spain evaluating BOSCO 4 at multiple institutions, Pegasus team refers users who just want Condor experience with Pegasus on top- referring to BOSCO. Chander talked to Kim Deelman, XSEDE Campus Champion interface—to hold off marketing BOSCO until we’re ready to market. (BOSCO officially out Jan. 7, beta is out now. )Tracking who is using by keeping track of downloads, when users click on website,  name, email , institution, how often downloaded is collected and added to spreadsheet; in terms of usage, adding Gratia probe to next release… if problems arise,  we have a mailing list for users to send issues to. Re: early adopters, we’re using at HTC to do a render farm… Pegasus user has an SGE cluster and wants to run Pegasus on it but it only runs Condor, solution is to overlay SGE with BOSCO.
         * “In terms of usage, deployed multi-user BOSCO on UC3, getting introduced to it behind the scenes. Multi user version of it- another type of use case-Rob Gardener.
         * More discussion on bigger picture items- short to medium term plan to enable this type of campus engagement, other type of plan is for CIC- what is correct metric, direction in terms of  executing goals etc… # users, # downloads part of bigger picture… what is cost of representing consortium to further this… Goal to enable and help science- using those resources for science when they need to … applications.. outcomes of that will demo whether technical path is a good one. 
         * 2 science VO’s run on UC3 have had publications, have asked about acknowledging the contribution- gave blurb for their papers mentioning UC3 .. these are being collected across campus infrastructure as  part of reporting-Lothar.

   * CIC Meeting Reports to the Council- Rob Gardener
      * Is there another org you are actively working with? -Bill B. Yes-ESNET, presentation from Andy Lake on Perfsonar at meeting…every campus has its own organization, engaging in various ways. Invited DiaGrid to Santa Cruz meeting- they’re already focused on bringing applications into a bridged environment that connects a number of campuses with Condor—we’re supporting those types of use cases. (can talk about further at OSG face to face)-Rob G. Is the purpose to share DHTC principals with campus researchers and help them leverage?- Chander.  Yes, this is the basic mission- Rob G.
