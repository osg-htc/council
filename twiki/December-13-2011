   *  Elections:  Executive Director term ends in March; Ruth will step down. See [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=314][Open Science Grid Management Plan]] OSG !DocDB Document 314 for Executive Team description and org chart and also [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=70][OSG Bylaws]] OSG !DocDB Document 70.  We need to find new ED; we are behind already.  Co-chairs will form a subcommittee to make a recommendation. Council should expect to receive more information on the process soon.

   * Council chair comes up as well. We currently have co-chairs, but the by-laws don’t stipulate this.  Take nominations starting immediately. Will be a similar voting procedure for ED and Council chair(s) – email vote.  If interested in running, let Paul and Rick know.  Look for email.
