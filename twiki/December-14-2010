---+++ Status Report from the OSG Executive Director, OSG Project Manager and/or Others

   * Executive Director Report (Ruth)
      * Usage of OSG staying fairly constant; including new use by ExTENCI application from UofC (see below).
      * Working with CDF and D0 on note that parallels the ATLAS/CMS "Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment of Core Services provided .."
      * 2 new applications with test runs across >3 OSG sites as a result of SC10: OpenSEES Earthquake Engineering simulation and Cactus gravitational physics simulation.
      * Continuing every 6 week phone meeting with NERSC and ANL Magellan projects. If VOs are interested in participating please let me know. Current attendees: ATLAS, CMS, HCC, STAR
      * Otherwise work gearing up to write proposal for mid Jan. Currently working with Eexecutive Team and core area coordinators: Production/Campus Grids - Dan,  Security - Mine, Software - Alain,Technology Investigation - Brian, User Support - Chander  who all have writing homeworks. Council members expect to be contacted for science input. 
   * GridUNESP School Report (Horst & Jose Caballero/BNL)
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Council/December-14-2010/Economics_of_Opportunistic_Resources.pdf][Economics of Opportunistic Computing in OSG]] (Jim Weichel)
      * A look at the incentives/disincentives of opportunistic computing
      * How can OSG set up a system to add more value to science and science projects?
      * Insurance Model (Providing real resource in return for opportunistic contributions)
         * If you deliver opportunistic resources to others, you can get priority for your future needs for opportunistic resources
      * OSG' as a Broker Model (Provide science projects with incentive to join OSG' with resources at 1/2 the Amazon price)
         * WIN for Funding agency - Computing at cost of average vs. peak need
         * WIN for Science Project - Computing peaks covered, may not have to deal with running own facilities
         * WIN for OSG' serves more Science Users and grows OSG capacity
         * WIN for the existing/new OSG members who can get paid for expansion of their facilities (by other projects)
   * All Hands Meeting Planning Update (Piotr)

Ruth gave executive report (see above). 

Horst and Jose gave a summary of the GridUNESP school. Over all it was seen as a huge success with 33 students in attendance.

Jim discussed the document (see link above) regarding the economics of opportunistic resources. The document captures Jim's observations and measurements since beginning with OSG in 2008. It is interesting that opportunistic usage has accounted for 30% of the usage with the past 10 months rising to roughly 35% of the usage. The VO's supporting opportunistic usage (17 out of 27) is based on the access seen by the Engage VO and may not be the same for other VOs. The issu of support is for opportunistic usage is seen to be a big part of the economics for external VOs. Some reduction in the support cost may be possible through VM technologies. Richard commented that a roadmap on how to get to this economic model should be part of a proposal, leveraging what has been accomplished so far. The question of whether or not the fact that many federal dollars for large computing resource included a requirement for university or state level matched funding went into the economic model - it was reported that it did not. It was also asked what the contractual arrangements for the "broker" model outlined might look like. Jim (and Igor) would like any feedback council members have be sent to them.

Piotr reported that SURAgrid has expressed interest in being a part of the OSG All Hands Meeting in March. Council members spoke about the history with SURAgrid and it seems there is now an interest in their becoming an OSG VO and leveraging the OSG software stack. This may also be a good candidate for a campus grid, as reported by John. SURAgrid would bring an additional 10 to 12 people to the AHM it is estimated. The draft agenda is up. The rooms are being held at $150 until the end of March. Details still need to be worked out by program committee.

---+++ Status Report from OSG Council Co-Chairs

   * Status for December Annual Report to DOE (Paul and Chander)
   * !ExTENCI update
      * Of the 4 subprojects, 3 are off to a good start
         * Lustre-WAN (CMS) have hardware and software up at PSC, UF, and FNAL and are doing initial testing
         * VM (STAR & CMS) has run the Clemson VMs at Purdue and visa-versa.  STAR used the Clemson cloud for a month with an average of 800 VMs (12B PYTHIA events)
         * Workflow and Client Tools (SCEC & Protein Folding) have split the SCEC load in TG and OSG parts and ran tests on those.  Protein folding applications have run on TG and 14 OSG sites and have peaked at 100K OSG hours on 2 days.
      * Job Submission (Coastal Modeling) is now defined (SOW not yet approved) and just beginning work
      * Working on the definition of additional VM work for UW to make VMs easier to create for different clouds and coming up with a distribrution and storage mechanism for VMs.

Chander and Paul reported on the annual report progress. Chander has all the internal pieces, Paul is still waiting for several important contributions for the science. Chander reported that this report needs to be approved in order for additional funds planned from the DOE for release in March to happen.

Jim reported on progress on the ExTENCI award (see above).

---+++ Round-Table Virtual Organization Reports and Issues:

   * Identification of a campus to be Campus Grid 
   * OSG' Planning Discussion

%BLUE% *minutes:*

Kent suggested that the recent centralization of computing resources at the Bates Center for MIT may make them a possible candidate for a campus grid. Ruth put it on her list to follow up with them again (she had previous discussion with MIT before the Bates Center was operational). It was also noted that SURAgrid might make a good campus grid by John. Chander will follow up with John Paul Robinson on this in a one-on-one conversation.
