---++ DOSAR Report: Horst Severini

   * we're still working on validating BOSCO -- I'll get back to that next week again, after this ATLAS Software Week is over 
   *  we are working with LaTech to get their compute resources 'grid-ified', so they can start running ATLAS MC on them. 
   * We're also trying to convince OU folks to adopt BOSCO, but that'll require some work, since people are used to logging into the OSCER cluster and submitting their jobs there, but we're trying to teach them that BOSCO would make their lives easier! Except for those people who have Windoze desktops -- of whom I'm afraid unfortunately there are many -- who are on their own. :)
