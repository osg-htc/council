Dear OSG Council

We continue to work with US ATLAS, US CMS and the WLCG to deploy and integrate the end-to-end service and resource validation (RSV) probes and collection framework to report smoothly to the WLCG site availability monitoring (SAM) and be reported correctly in the management board Tier-2 reliability and availability reports.

We continue to follow up on the action items identifed at the stakeholder quarterly meetings. D0 is reporting its efficiencies every week and, while there has been an incremental improvement, things are far from optimal. US ATLAS and US CMS are part of the WLCG Combined Computing Readiness Challenge and are once again ramping up use of the OSG across the board.

There has been a recent increase in use by LIGO running the Einstein@Home application on several OSG sites, in addition to a local maximum in Engage VO usage with throughput of over 1,500 CPUdays/day for a couple of days.
