*Executive Directors Report*

OSG operations have been tracking and supporting the ATLAS and CMS Step09 activities. There were no major support issues for OSG. Problem reports were opened and closed in a timely fashion. There has been a post mortem workshop where the experiments and WLCG service presented the production and analysis results. There are many lessons learned especially related to data storage and access and efficiencies. 

There has been a recent surge in usage of OSG by the Engage VO as new applications from Duke (Theoretical Nuclear Physics) and U of Chicago (Computer Science) are coming on-line.

The annual report to NSF was received by NSF. Much thanks to all of the Council for their input and especially to Chander and Paul for pulling it all together and making a coherent whole.

You will hear later about Paul’s keynote at the TeraGrid 09 conference. The OSG Trash/Engagement team also presented their work on an “application portal/gateway” that accesses both OSG and TG resources. One team from Clemson participated in the student programming contest and 3 students from OSG – from Maryland and the University of Nebraska - presented posters. We are following up from these activities in preparation for next year. 

The storage workshop at the end of June saw more than 30 attendees focusing on the technical details of the installed storage implementations, tools and tips for site administrators to reduce their loads and improve the robustness of their sites, and discussion of the main needs and options as input to the short term work.

There was a two-day documentation alignment workshop held in June  that was attended by 9 OSG staff and led by external consultants with expertise in information science.   The current state of all OSG related content was reviewed, and stakeholders needs and requests were summarized from individual interviews.  Several ideas were developed with the strategic goal of moving the OSG forward with regard to having a reliable and sustainable framework for technical information content, suitable for new and more seasoned users, VO application developers, site administrators, software & service providers, and facilities managers.  Findings and outcomes from the workshop can be found in the OSG documentation database, http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=861.

Also the Executive Board recently submitted, and plans follow up on,  the following papers:

to our ASCR manager related to discussions ongoing with DOE about software sustainability and infrastructure persistence:

to MPS, OCI and EHR divisions at NSF,  jointly with TeraGrid, a paper on National Workforce Developement

A main focus of the core teams is testing the OSG 1.2 release on the Trash/Trash/Integration Test Bed. We appreciate the testing by the application teams - essential to increase the reliability of the resulting production release and deployment in a couple of weeks.
