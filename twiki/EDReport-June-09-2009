Dear OSG Council

Production is continuing without major problems at present. Trash/Engagement has had more usage in the last few weeks of May. The current phases of the OSG VO Group Nanohub Taskforce has been completed.

The Nanohub report from Steve Clark and Abhishek reads “With current 6 application jobtypes, nanoHUB's production across OSG has ramped up manyfold in May'09, and has been sustained at 600-800 wall hours/day. Resource failure rate is less than 1%. Link failure rate (lack of availability) is nearly 12%. Influx of nanoHUB end-user jobs is expected in near future.” (see plot below for current test job running).

Geant4 validation applications are now running at 60-100 jobs a day following a week long visit by Trash/Engagement to CERN to help with the use of the Ganga/Diana software stack on OSG.  From the original request: “Target is to test each release candidate within 1 day turnaround time for small/medium sets of jobs (200-500 configurations) and 2 days for the largest sets (2500 jobs).”  Next is for us to understanding the production requests now that the initial deployment has made progress.

The Tier-3 group is meeting weekly and developing patterns of support and a list of needs from OSG and the communities working together. The software group is working steadily towards the release of OSG 1.2 based on VDT 1.2. The first release of VDT 1.2 has been tested by the VTB and is entering Trash/Trash/Integration testing. We will be asking the VOs for testing very soon and are asking that this cycle be as focused and quick as possible to meet the release date at the end of July.

The Security Team held a test of response to a security incident with the BNL and FNAL Tier-1s on behalf of the WLCG. The measured response was good. The Joint Security Policy Group is in the final stages of agreement to new policies for the Virtual Organisation Registration Security Policy - V2.5, dated 18 May and Virtual Organisation Membership Management Policy - V3.6, dated 18 May

The Executive Board expects to agree to the VO Registration Security Policy with the exception of  adopting (ie we will Not adopt)  the naming convention for VO names. (see "The VO name must be formatted as a subdomain name as specified in the IETF RFC1034 section 3.5. The VO Manager of a VO using a thus-formatted name must be entitled to the use of this name, when interpreted as a name in the Internet Domain Name System. This entitlement must stem either from a direct delegation of the corresponding name in the Domain Name System by an accredited registrar for the next-higher level subdomain, or from a direct delegation of the equivalent name in the Domain Name System by ICANN, or from the consent of the administrative or operational contact of the next-higher equivalent subdomain name for that VO name that itself is registered with such an accredited registrar."

OSG has a draft VO Membership Management Policy under discussion but we have been unable to get traction with the VO contacts to date. The US LHC experiments follow the JSPG policy based on their acceptance of  WLCG and EGEE policies through the global collaborations.

The task force I asked to advise me on the MyOSG migration from VORS has made its preliminary report and is working on additional items – especially a list of and use cases for applications/VOs depending on VORS for the end of this month. The documentation task force will have a report and meeting at the end of June.

I will report on the current status of OSG satellite proposals and planning for the future.

We are making progress but have not completed our requirements gathering due to other loads. Thus the proposed Future Planning Phase 1 for June 30, 2009 will be delayed by a few weeks. I will be making more phone calls in the near future.

Phase 1 for June 30 2009:

    •Gather and document requirements & expectations from major stakeholders for 2010 to 2015<br>
    •Solicit guidance from OSG Council on key directions for future

Phase 2 by Aug 2009 Face-to-Face Council Mtg

    • 2-page plan for each OSG work area (or functional unit)<br>
    • List/abstract of satellite proposals

Phase 3 by Dec 2009

    •Analysis => outline for proposal<br>
    •Document Architecture<br>
    •Identify particpating senior personnel (and institutions)

Phase 4 at March 2010 All Hands Meeting

    •Endorsement of proposal by stakeholders<br>
    •OSG Future proposal to NSF/DOE by March 30, 2010
