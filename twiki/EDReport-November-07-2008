Dear OSG Council

On behalf of the Executive Team, I have sent the attached current OSG position statement with respect to the EGI to Bob Jones (who requested such by 31st October), Dieter Krunzmuller (previous lead of EGI design team) and Lud&#283;k Matyska (understood to the current head of the EGI design team). We have also sent copies to NSF and DOE.

The usage of the OSG has been maintained at the level of 20,000 CPU weeks/week, with average use by Engage and other non-physics VOs.

We have held quarterly meeting with Nanohub and the annual meeting with NYSGrid.

Nanohub had only a 60% job success rate on OSG in FY08, and did not meet their science milestones for last year. There is a VO group task force now working with Steve Clark at Purdue and the Condor team with Trash/Engagement work through the problems.

The focus of the task force with SBGrid is now turning to successfully integrating condor-g submission into their application portal and running science runs towards publishing a paper from the results. The application has been run on the SBGrid and UCSD sites (see attached accounting plot). Tests at GLOW and FermiGrid have exposed new problems in the use of the new VO management release. These are being actively looked into.

Nanohub, LIGO and SBGrid are exposing problems and errors in our accounting system which affect the configurations used by their applications. We are looking into these but do not think they currently affect the HEP applications.

We plan to have a draft of the “Value offered by OSG” paper to distribute and discuss at the December Council meeting. This will be one of the papers made available to the OSG reviewers in January. The OSG review is now determined as a joint DOE SciDAC and NSF review for 14/15th January in Washington DC. This will be the focus of my and the project manager’s work for the next 2 months. I am happy to talk to any Council members on the phone about this event.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with question and issues

Ruth
