Here is my biweekly report.

The OSG presence at the LHC Grid Fest seemed to go well. We had interested visitors to our table; the RENCI vizualization of non-physics jobs being submitted, matched, executed and completed on OSG was a great hit both at CERN and in the USA. John McGee and I had useful conversations with Ed Seidel (NSF) and Glen Crawford (DOE) and we hope something useful comes out of it.

The SBGrid Task Force has made progress with all SBGrid resources now being "green" and finally having daily functional test results that sometimes show 100%. The next steps are to maintain availability and reliability to be >80% for a week; and then be 90% for a month before December. Work is also continuing in the Trash/Engagement area on helping the SBGrid run their first applications over multiple OSG sites.

There will be a site administrators workshop at SLAC November 12th and 13th. We encourage all - especially new - site administrators to attend. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/SiteCoordination/SiteAdminsWorkshop2008

We are starting small with an effort to deploy distributed accounting repositories and to encourage site administrators and users to pay attention to the daily reports - and especially note anomalies. We are collecting a lot of data - we need to make sure it is useful. We are also going back to validate information about opportunistic use now the registration database has more accurate information about ownership of resources, and supports a particular resource to be owned by multiple organizations.
