         * Motion to make Council meetings Quarterly for 2-3 hours. (Council members can provide input now)- Request by Jerome to consider quarterly “longer” meetings and retain monthly meetings.
         * Members  contributions/needs/benefits  dialog  
         * Notre Dame application to become a member of the Council- (Feedback requested regarding Jarek’s/ ND’s qualifications.-Jarek  broadens participation since ND is a multidisciplinary organization with VO registered to non-physics users; Jarek is a Campus representative; ND is a resource , CMS Tier 3 facility and does software development for -dv/dt-Ruth)

         *  93. Check “if a VO is using a file that is NOT a root file, will it work with AAA?” in response to a question from Gabriele.-Ken Bloom (The answer is yes.- Ken Bloom)
    

---+++ Committee reports.
   * Subcommittee on Industry - [[%ATTACHURL%/OSGs_Relationships_with_Industry.pdf][Draft Report]] - David, Ken, Piotr, Ruth 
      The Subcommittee has drafted some recommendations in terms of direction and also a couple of pilot activities to recommend to the OSG project for discussion. The subcommittee is also discussing communicating to the project some comments on the existing policy of commercial use of the OSG fabric of services.  
      * Grappling with scope of the document (general and specific initial activities), audience is internal to OSG, some feedback requested whether it emphasizes importance of partnerships - whether and how to incorporate this. HCC is having some of these same issues, same infrastructure requirements by both commercial and academic users; pursuing Amazon resources. Piotr has done some work on a project document for the Executive Team containing guidelines for engaging commercial organizations- Ruth is  sending to ET for discussion first.- David Swanson
   * Subcommittee on Council Structure - Amber, Vicky, Ruth The Subcommittee drafted recommendations to propose to the Council:  
      * Remove the less than specific sentence from the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=25][Charter for the Open Science Grid]]: "A structure of management and coordination bodies oversees and coordinates the work of the Consortium."
      * Clarify terms, responsibilities, and remove mention of the Scientific Advisory Group from the By-Laws- proposed changes at: [[%ATTACHURL%/ByLaws-2013.pdf][Open Science Grid Consortium By-Laws]].
      * Trying to clarify responsibilities of Council, make members of bodies clearer. Strategic input was solicited to influence shaping the Council for this vs. being a clearing house for technical ideas. Council has a role not just with funded project but determining which projects are appropriate to take on as satellites of OSG- broader role than simply providing oversight to Executive team. - Amber
      * Previous By-Laws talked about Executive Board, Executive Team is the group that is the active body guiding/ proposing/reviewing work done by the project and the direction/goals. Council is a body to whom ET is responding and is influenced by. Project can come to Council , regarding useful projects etc. Effort is assigned to this role of Council. By-Laws did not previously talk about satellites… can introduce into discussion and description, mentioned in Management plan part of project reporting to agencies, have not been introduced to Council.-Ruth
      * Are projects and satellites all the same? How do you want to shape?- Jerome - Additional project managers and leads were part of original Management plan but in practices it constitutes leads/satellites i.e. Ewa/Miron.  Discussion- not participating in Executive Team or Executive Board. Make it explicit in wording, part of clarification of Consortium, clarify role, interfaces to satellites as part of governing documents-Ruth
      * Structure as intended is not happening- people not aware of how it should have been? Make role of Council clearer and more functional… Suggestion to get Council members more involved in activities. Reports from committees. Disengagement of Council members – have to be very active- Jerome - Council members are engaged with Activities of the Council itself… Ken has OSG issues as part of Tier II meetings and work, Bill and Rob are heavily in engaged in OSG from Operations and Bill leading Council infrastructure, engaged in a real sense…Council benefiting from this but not defining what Council brings to this. -Ruth
      * Benefit of Council members embedded , harder to have bigger picture strategic direction when it’s composed of people executing the work. What is the constituency, does it have to be as representative as it is? Council member rep. broader sense of people. OSG functioning well. Council members carrying flame of OSG as a whole. Serves as advocates in broader world for OSG- future subcommittee, future face to face topic?- Amber
      * Track changes not appearing in By-Laws document.- Jerome - Previously  only available as a PDF not a doc file. No changes to mission of the Council made. Clarification not a change. Inconsistencies between By-Laws and Management plan will work with Lothar to clean this up. Amber and Vicky’s philosophy to work with some tweaks instead of anything drastic. -Ruth
   * 3rd Subcommittee on Sustainability- to draft a report- will have something to discuss in March.


---+++   Unfinished business.

---+++   Standing Items of the OSG Project
   * OSG has committed 2M hours per quarter for XSEDE users; this is approximately 666K hours per month.  In January 2013, the usage was approximately 2.2M hours (not counting the 0.5M hours used by CSIU which represents an OSG user at the Indiana University School of Medicine).  We have been advised by the chair of the XSEDE Resource Allocation Committee (XRAC) that there are requests for 10M-20M hours pending against OSG at the March 11 meeting; historically OSG has made 2M hours available each quarter.  
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Council/February-12-2013/Recent_OSG-XSEDE_usage.png][OSG-XSEDE Usage History]] - traditional view from Gratia
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Council/February-12-2013/XDMod_OSG_5-feb-2013.JPG][OSG Usage]] - as reported in XDMod   
         * Huge demand for OSG hours through XSEDE interface- Big uptick in usage in Dec. (1M hours. Question is whether usage pattern to continue to grow at this rate? Not enough data to substantiate. We need to develop a strategy to address this issue, Miron and Lothar aware– allocated amount plus discretionary amount- no firm conclusion yet. By June- Purdue Condor pool is being decommissioned- 1 of existing HTC resources is going away. OSG is becoming known and useful.- Chander
         * We don’t have good methods for predicting how much opportunistic usage we’ll have in the future- and how much we should offer. Guidance, thoughts on how to deal with?- Chander
         * Capacity for OSG/XSEDE- how many we could provide through this gateway…potentially 10M hours could be there.-Rob Quite a bit of capacity available- come up with responsible level of commitment on this interface.-Chander
         * Why do they want us in particular, go through XSEDE why not OSG directly? -Ken - People came in through XSEDE- Don Krieger U of Pittsburg, mapping human brain, people doing this work can construct their work as serial jobs… Issue is people with no resources but with demands- how do Council members feel about this? Attach resources in a sharing agreement, and now a significant amount of that is used externally, it’s a difference from where we’ve been.- Chander
         * Interesting problem with many dimensions, has many political aspects. Allocate face to face time to discuss. -Lothar
         * XSEDE- Opportunistic resources no one else is using, we should get credit for this, pre-screening, but take credit for what is happening - more discussion and thinking—some steps/direction/ path for starting to use XSEDE resources- discuss. –Chander  Put forward separating technical from policy—resources users can submit to high throughput resources or high performance resources- nice meaty technical projects a satellite proposal could be built around- doesn’t address resource, policy or sharing issues- consider two things separately- very fruitful thing to discuss with agencies.- Amber. Consortium members contribute resources- appropriate for Council to discuss and give guidance on- Lothar agrees.  Think very hard on tech issues while we take time to get policy issues straight- start the discussion.
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/BOSCO_Package_Download_Form_1.pdf][BOSCO Download report]]- Feedback to give to Derek:  exclude testing; classify report by region, by domain (IP address), by Country. Timeframe is a few months  since BOSCO only just released. -Chander
---+++   New business.
   * Input from Council members on items that they would like to see on future agendas.

---+++   Announcements.
   * Date of next meeting: March 14-15, [[http://pti.iu.edu/osgahm-2013][OSG All Hands meeting]] at Indiana University 
---+++ Adjournment.
