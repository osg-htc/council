---+++ Officers Reports:
   * Council Chair -  Ruth Pordes
      * Status of [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Council/CouncilActionItems][Action Items]]  - Ruth
         * Campus Grid items complete based on discussion at Dec 2012 Council meeting; BES communities report action item transitioned based on report from Michael/Amber at Dec Council meeting. 
            * Follow up discussion at face-to-face in March.
            * 9 open action items- Ruth to review and follow up on as time permits.
      * Globus Online-Report- Steve Tuecke (Action Item 51: Ask Executive team to get a statement regarding Globus Online.) <i>Goal is for Council members to understand GO,  its use cases, stakeholder needs sufficiently to recommend or not further steps towards support as part of  OSG software or production services. </i> 
         * Quick demo of new capability around sharing . It’s as easy as a drop box but for big data: move your file systems; any storage system provider can plug into  GO system and share with that system and any GO user.
         * Endpoint: new menu option called “Share”.  To export it- give it a new logical name; can put permission against that. Can set read, write permissions in Endpoint and open another Endpoint instance  and can transfer to and from between the two--- don’t need to copy to cloud directly instead use a “to and from” local system.
         * Major new capability: Group Management. Can manage settings.. self help manage group, invite participants by email address, group names etc. “End-user-facing” group management system.  Can use for sharing…make simple sharing available to user community--- administer, can create settings…set up sharing dmz on your site- users can share within those constraint.
         * Key GO goal is long term sustainability; how to bring in a revenue stream off of GLOBUS online- allowing U of C to operate and support it as a service… 
         * This is the first feature that will only be available as a paid feature. Sharing for end-users…any site can turn on ability to share for free.. for users who purchase a plus plan. Basic plan is Free; Plus plan is  $7 month or $70 a year..(Add peer- to peer transfer capability. Free for stored system provider to turn on, users pay for right to…) Second model, can share from one end point…as platform for their own web GUI’s.
         * How would people pay? (Vicky) [Two pricing models: target market is computer groups..(research community org), user- can recharge to their grants, some want to turn on for all users and they will absorb cost into their research IT computing budget. U of C can support PO’s, invoicing, normal legal stuff…as a commercial service being purchased.]
         * Do you know which OSG stakeholders are using GO? (Ruth) [Steve unsure, recommends consulting Brian Bockelman. HDFS to work with GLOBUS Online. Brian’s working on. Just started rolling out service. File access with simple sharing across different users- STAR use it to some extent for BNL/PDF file transfers.-(Jerome) Based on conversations/ feedback received from users of HPC systems (have simulations want to share for secondary analysis), Perkin Elmer (sequencing facilities), users  of advanced Photon source at Argonne. Ad hoc sharing- small project teams want to cross multiple Campus organizations and share data sets, images.-(Steve T.) ESnet believes Globus Online is a very useful - in fact exemplary - tool, happy to elaborate over email.-(Greg Bell) Using at Univ. of Florida as part of HPC initiative.-(Paul Avery)
         * Is this part of an “OSG-blessed” infrastructure tool suite? Should we recommend to VOs to use? Would VOs be more likely on their own to decide? -(Ken) 
         * Can Council members comment on whether this is a useful service to recommend? OSG to take a look at difference in mission between OSG Org. and OSG Project…distinction between Project providing distributed computing;  OSG foundation (non-profit) providing whatever IT services are needed by its constituency. –(Steve T.) What is expected of executive team- to get a statement? –(Lothar) Sites can make contract with GLOBUS online directly…VOs can bulk buy… should OSG give it as a service that is available at most OSG sites vs. individual sites? [See Action Item 1 above.]
         * What is the overall mission and goals of OSG? [OSG model is to support things driven by stakeholder needs and requests.-(Lothar)]



   * Executive Director - Report  - Lothar Bauerdick
      * PKI- Written Report- Von Welch. <i> Goal is to communicate to Council members the status of  and provide an opportunity for  question or comment  on the progress of the PKI Transition </i> [[%ATTACHURL%/OSG_VOs_and_PKI_RA_Progress.pdf][OSG VO and PKI RA Progress- Report]]; [[%ATTACHURL%/PKI_notes.pdf][OSG VO and PKI RA Progress- Notes]]
         * About to see a major shift in user base with switch in certificates -coming in with different grid credentials and parent identities- how to map? For CMS Tier 2's, Tony Tiradani is looking into this- it's on their minds and they will be dealing with in next few months.-(Ken)
         * Project at Fermilab to support transition locally.-(Vicky)
         * OSG will monitor impact to users and on sites. OSG is proactive in commissioning of this since June...concerns are real...and we are addressing. -(Lothar)
         * We will pay continuing attention to this cover the next 6 months before and after March 23. -(Ruth)

---+++  Special orders --- Important business previously designated for consideration at this meeting.
   * Satellite Reports to the Council. <i>Goal is to provide Council members information about a project which aims to contribute to the OSG vision and hear about its status and potential for use by OSG stakeholders, and to recommend or not further steps towards potential support as part of  OSG fabric of services.</i>
      * Any Data Anytime Any Where (AAA) Project Report - Ken Bloom   [[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/26164791/aaa_130108.pdf][AAA presentation]];         [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/AnyDataAnyTimeAnyWhere][AAA Twiki page]]
         * How can we get this deployed to other VO’s that might benefit from AAA? [Follow up on this topic with feedback from email and in future Council meetings.-(Ruth) ATLAS efforts…a lot of overlap, aggressive caching and XrootD- watching AAA product. - (Jim Shank)]
         * What type of info. do you need to deploy to a site?- (Gabriele) [A number of XrootD servers on the site.. don’t put on every node in storage system, data gets run through there-Xrootd- (Ken)]
         * Is the plan to provide as part of OSG” Is the OSG project working closely to make this happen? Do you want a broader view beyond CMS?- RP [From Project perspective, AAA for LHC is a game changer. Questions about non –root files and deployment; replaces data placement by data access. A big part of the data management problem. All future stuff… if it can deploy infrastructure… not having to place files where computers are… don’t rely on root IO, wide application potential on OSG.-(Lothar)]
         * Is this on the roadmap for AAA project? (Brian chief technologist…)- Lothar  [ATLAS has project with AAA deliverables.. Rob Gardener is a good person to head that.] 
         * Technology is open for business?-(Ruth) [A bit early… relies on services that are deployed… relies on specific IO model, http access within XrootD is on the roadmap- not on same level as Globus online yet-- we’re exploring the path and making more generic… can’t deploy for own VO today.-(Lothar) Receptive to hear from other VO’s i.e. things to shoot for, to make it more generally useful. Demands and requirements in community help to move along next stages.-(Ken) If OSG can help with that it would be wonderful.-(Lothar) Might be VO drive, if hear from VO’s interested in this we’d start to talk to them.-(Ken)]

---+++   Standing Items of the OSG Project
   * OSG has committed 2M hours per quarter for XSEDE users; this is approximately 170,000 hours per week.  Over the last 30 weeks, usage has averaged about 93,000 hours per week; in the last 3 weeks this has climbed to 400,000 hours per week due to two users who have been very active (and this dovetails well with the drop-off in total OSG usage over the holiday period).
