----+++ Items for Friday meeting

   1 Revisit the dates for face to face meetings in light of existing Council and potential Council member conflicts.
   1 Give a statement with respect to quarterly vs. monthly meetings - Ruth.


----+++ Action items generated

   1 Subcommittee to report on subclassifications of organizations to the consortium (such as to distinguish in OIM PKI-only VOs from VOs that consume other services)
   1  follow up on VLab - Ruth
   1 A response is needed from the project concerning accounting based on this meeting and elsewhere. Determine whether accounting in reports meets everyone's needs. For example, VO acronyms are not useful to the uninitiated within the NSF, department directors, etc. Find effort for accounting. Currently there is virtually none. We have to show which funding office or director we service. -- Lothar, Ruth, 
   1. Tell the VOs and users that they are expected to provide citations when the OSG is referenced. Follow up with council members on this - Ruth
   1. discuss (offline) whether OSG is a specifically USA institution, in contrast to defining OSG as an international entity. This question emerged regarding the goal of cultivating connections to Latin America and Asia. 


MOTION:  To thank Von from the project for his hard work and a smooth transition.
<i>Passed unopposed.</i>

MOTION: Accept the plan from NEES 2 to partner with OSG. <i>Passed unopposed.</i>



---++March 15th
---+++ Special orders 
   * 8.30 am.....Resources - discuss policy for resource usage by members, users, non-members;  how to find additional resource contributors. (Action item 95).

*Sustainability Cont*
   * consider how to retain and attract employees who will drive, guide and grow OSG.
   * Some council members think that brain drain is not an organizational problem, but just the inevitable result of typical career growth that you will find anywhere
   *  in contrast, it was suggested that there is no clear career advancement trajectory from within the organization and that people are forced to leave to progress
   *  another theory is that the work is not varied enough and that the rate of innovation and the enthusiasm that accompanies it may have dropped off.
   *  it was also suggested our employees who are less than 1 FTE may be less inclined to commit to OSG because their priorities lie with another organization
   * outreach may need to be done to get scientists in different disciplines to be interested in larger scale computing
 
MOTION: to ask the executive director to sponsor a process to get a white paper including input from inside and outside members of the consortium to outline a path to sustainability for OSG. <i>Passed unopposed.</i>
 
   * Organize a framework to generate/accept collaboration, solicitations and proposals. Rob G found success on this topic with a series of meetings and workshops in the past.
---+++ Council Member Visions
Each member is asked to present their  the following topics covering the next few years of their thinking:
   * Why OSG is important to me 
   * How I plan to help the Campus Program
   * What I want/plan to do over the next two years to lead - ensuring the success of the OSG
   * OSG evangelization/ambassador efforts
   * What staff I am contributing and would like to contribute to the OSG activities
