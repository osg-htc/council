%BLUE% 
Items are grouped into broad categories. The asterisked items denote things Ruth will follow up on in the near term. Ruth can accept new input and add to this document.

 What was learned from this exercise is that people are very committed to contribute, OSG is thought of as a good forum for communications, community, collaboration.  Interest was expressed in strategic objectives and the activity path of the council and the future of the OSG consortium as an organization. Respondents want to do things together, as it provides value in the broader ecosystem of OSG. Strong interest in having more in depth discussion of OSG strategic issues at council meetings and in reaching out to new communities.

OSG as XSEDE SP status update - Chander Sehgal 


%ENDCOLOR%

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/OSG_as_XSEDE_SP_Report_for_Council_on_8may2012.pdf][OSG as XSEDE SP status update]] - Chander Sehgal
%BLUE% OSG user support started tracking April 1.- See Chander’s notes for further detail. Mats Rynge will attend the next RAC meeting in Knoxville.

%ENDCOLOR%


   * OSG CA status - Von Welch
%BLUE% Please reference: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation

Decision made in February to use DigiCert authority- an OSG front end for cert. requests and retaining history of what certs have been requested and authorized. 

OSG PKI work in final stages of planning phase (getting documents done, ironing out technical details) - ends May 18th 

Technical plans for new OIM based front end and contractual arrangements with DigiCert Dev and deploy phase is Oct 1- begin transition of users outside of technical staff to receive new certificates. Estimated starting point for when these renewals start migrating. Won’t be required until current certificate expires.

Goal to have a replacement PKI for DOE grids by Jan 2013.

June meeting with XSEDE to explore – more informal discussion as they go through their planning process for a possible PKI.

More communications and detail will occur closer to the transition.

---+++ More In Depth Discussion
   * Status of Globus/CDIGS support  - Steve Tuecke, MIron Livny, Ruth Pordes
%BLUE% Steve stated that nothing has changed from GLOBUS side- 1 or 2 months ago. Funding from NSF for GLOBUS toolkit will expire in July/Aug. NSF funding is a ¼ of a person related to XSEDE work. Ongoing discussion occurring with NSF re: what’s needed, who’s using it -otherwise nothing new to report.

Evaluating need and costs associated with this from OSG’s perspective would be a good next step

Miron: GRAM interface -where are we heading given glideinWMS pilot approach we are taking?

Given GRIDFTP is part of GLOBUS online, where are the boundaries on this as we move forward? GLOBUS funding is to build new GLOBUS online functionality. Supporting broader community is what’s missing.

If there’s no funding, does GRID FTP go away? Switch to using GLOBUS online clients? Come up with a plan that makes sense.

OSG has a process that we follow when situations like this arise. (Limited funding for software providers)- we used this for Bestman.

Have to provide the right service to the software provider as well as to address needs of our users. OSG considered as a resource for the funding agencies in this regard.

Current support and associated resources exhaust roughly at the end of July (Steve)

---+++ OSG Satellites 

   * In flight Proposals:
      * New ASCR proposal - Miron Livny

%BLUE% dV/Dt Proposal was successfully submitted. “…Accelerating the Transition to Extreme Scale Collaborative Computing”.

Coming up with new framework/ ideas and prototyping them and trying them out to scale, no promise to create as tools, responsibility of software providers to bring into their tools, a theme of 4 universitys and 1 DOE lab- Notre Dame- resp. for data aspect, Univ. of SO Cal ISI – resp. for planning, UCSD Frank leading this effort to be resp. for prototyping and testing on OSG and includes Argonne leadership facility with Bill Alcock resp. for facility, U of WI, faculty resp. for networking and Bob Miller leading trust activity, Miron involved with processing- emphasis on bringing data and networking into a planning process in acquiring resources on the fly. 1 Programmer at ND helping to build the prototype. 

Put in a small req. in budget to buy cycles out of Amazon- acquire resources not only on OSG or Argonne but how on the fly we can acquire resources in the cloud (Amazon) Budget is 1.2 a year- shouldn’t expect full budget. 

Proposal that came out of Argonne and APS- has an OSG component- Steve T- APS is looking at adding some compute stuff- we’re proposing a condor- based process- can leverage/ gather compute facilities out there, interesting interactions with OSG downstream.
