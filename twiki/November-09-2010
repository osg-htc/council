DOE Extension is requesting funding at the 75% level, the remaining 25% will come from savings from delays in early hiring starts.

All Hands Meeting program committee consists of 9 individuals. They had their first meeting yesterday. Expect to have registration start before Thanksgiving. 

VM's running on OSG sites using existing job submission would properly account for usage. Sites would need configuration guidelines. A review by technology group and security group are called out as the next step. Sebastien has been given points of contact for moving forward.

Council asked to review offline the VOSS status report provided by Jim Weichel
