   1 Subcommittee to report on subclassifications of organizations to the consortium (such as to distinguish in OIM PKI-only VOs from VOs that consume other services)
   1  follow up on VLab - Ruth
   1 A response is needed from the project concerning accounting based on this meeting and elsewhere. Determine whether accounting in reports meets everyone's needs. For example, VO acronyms are not useful to the uninitiated within the NSF, department directors, etc. Find effort for accounting. Currently there is virtually none. We have to show which funding office or director we service. -- Lothar, Ruth, 
   1. Tell the VOs and users that they are expected to provide citations when the OSG is referenced. Follow up with council members on this - Ruth
   1. discuss (offline) whether OSG is a specifically USA institution, in contrast to defining OSG as an international entity. This question emerged regarding the goal of cultivating connections to Latin America and Asia. 


MOTION:  To thank Von from the project for his hard work and a smooth transition.
<i>Passed unopposed.</i>

MOTION: Accept the plan from NEES 2 to partner with OSG. <i>Passed unopposed.</i>
