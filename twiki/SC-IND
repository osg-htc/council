A sub-committee of the Open Science Grid Consortium Council is asked to write a proposal for the Consortium’s strategic goals for industry relationships and engagement over the next 5-10 years:
   * Clarify the goals, principles and approaches for the OSG Consortium's interactions with Commercial Organizations (where organizations covers physical and virtual organizations, as well as the individuals who are part of such organizations).
