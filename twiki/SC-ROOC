---++ OSG Subcommittee to address Re-Organization of OSG Council

---+++ Purpose:

Review and make recommendations regarding the organization of the OSG Council. The subcommittee will be charged with making recommendations for changes that are seen to be advantageous to the strategic planning of the Open Science Grid and should include a careful review of the relationship between the OSG Executive Team, The OSG Executive Board and the OSG Council. Additionally, the organizational classification of the OSG representatives could be improved to better capture our membership roles. The subcommittee will be asked to present their findings and make a recommendation at the next face-to-face OSG Council Meeting in approximately 6 months (~September 2008).
