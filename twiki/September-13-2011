---+++ Announcements

   *  None
---+++ Action Item Follow-up from August Meeting

  ACTION ITEMS:
   * Find where Council is mentioned in OSG documents:
      * Action Closed. 
      * ACTION REVISE CHARTER
         * Charter talks about facility but not goals/activities, discussed in March changing it to include services.  Will do so and submit to council at the next meeting.


   * Update on discussions with ESNET DOEGrids CA 
      * Ruth – take some functionality out of ESNET; our security team writing a document. Only starting but it’s happening. Shared goal to sustain and support infrastructure.  Will take a year at least.

   * Status of Bestman assessment 
      * Meetings today and tomorrow in Chicago. Information is [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/BestmanReview][here]]. Will result in a written report which will be presented to the Executive Team, stakeholders and also made available to the Berkeley team. All three communities will work together to find a workable solution for the long term support.

   * Report from Council members approaching sponsors:
      * Run II - Brad Abbott, Rick Snider 
      * ATLAS, CMS - MIchael Ernst, Bob Clare
      * other
         * Everyone is working on it. What’s the time scale – special contact with DOE, or at scheduled meetings?  The proposal is in the DOE now; our funding drop dead is March, so if you’re not talking to DOE for several months normally, then it would be good to do so in September.  ATLAS – Michael reports they have spoken with DOE people, it went well and is explained through the assessment paper written a while back.  Feel DOE/NSF people understand.

   * Update on interactions with ESNET - MIchael Ernst
      * Aug 25-26 M. Ernst met Steve Cotter and others.  They offered us an outreach team who can be approached. If there’s an activity to present potential cooperation on, they are open. First step could be: ATLAS and CMS are working in area of federated storage policies, jobs run on the grid will need to access WAN and we expect some issues e.g., working on a farm node, where we’d need to involve network experts.  This is a good example where we might try this mechanism.  Cotter is very serious about it and trying to come up with something workable that they can deliver.  So no specific action on this but it is ongoing.

   * Present information about other XD Projects - in addition to (OSG), XSEDE - Ruth, Miron
      * If you look at funding, you don’t see XD anywhere so you don’t know which projects are contributing to the program.  The solicitation in 2008 was for 4 items (as listed on website), and lots of hardware awards are not directly related to (XSEDE). We also always talk about the datanet project, and workshops are being funded by NSF to discuss these issues.  There’s a slew of other XD projects, and Miron went to Washington but has anyone else been to NSF to talk about it or willing to go?  We’re nowhere near actually getting an award.  Paul remarks these are some rather large awards.
Reminder of original solicitation and the outcome:

   * A data-intensive, high-performance computing system - Outcome: <b> Flash Gordon at SDSC </b>
   * An experimental high-performance computing system of innovative design - <b>?PSC SGI that was withdrawn?</b>
   * An experimental, high-performance grid test-bed. - Outcome: <b>FutureGrid</b> https://portal.futuregrid.org/ </b>
   * A pool of loosely coupled grid-computing resources.  - Outcome: <b> Purdue  proposal Not funded ;</b>
   
 Associated are:
   * Visualization project at ORNL
   * DataNetONE (Observation Network for Earth), Michener, William,	University of New Mexico
   * The Data Conservancy (A Digital Research and Curation Virtual Organization), Choudhury, Golam, Johns Hopkins University
 
In 2011 solicitation: http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2011/nsf11511/nsf11511.htm. This has [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Council/September-13-2011/NSF_-_Award_Search_-_Program_Information.pdf][previously funded acquisitions]]. 
 

   * Update on "allocations" - Miron, Chander
      * You can go to every site but not easily.  Demand continues to increase, which could become critical at some point.  These factors have caused us to think about allocations and priorities.  Frank presented some concepts at OSG staff retreat in July.  Potentially:  Sites could have autonomy, set preferences/priorities or allow OSG to do so. Need to work on methods and practices to decide how to divvy up. 
Asking for input from the Council.


   * WLCG working groups  
      * Letter sent to Ian Bird
      * OSG Members welcomed on all groups
      * Kick off date "soon"
      * Submitted names and a letter has been sent to management boards but haven’t heard that groups have been kicked off.  Brian represents both OSG and CMS on this.
      * Close action Item


   *  Exchanges with Americas - update on wiki page - Jose Caballero
      * Please read [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Education/ExchangeProgram#osgsites2012][this brief note]] of what has been done so far.
      * Proposal to bring a student for a few months to work in an OSG facility to become an expert on OSG systems and infrastructure.  Decided in last meeting that he’d write a wiki with description, which is included here.  He’s been in touch with three facilities.  Only question is which type of visa is appropriate, perhaps a J1 is best.

   * Strategic Plan - update
      * Received comments from council members and is discussing whether Miron signs off when he next visits FNAL.  Goal is to have done for next all hands. Still accepting comments on the document.
