---++ Sub-Committee Charter

A sub-committee of the Open Science Grid Consortium Council is asked to write a proposal for how to :-
   * Clarify the roles, responsibilities and authorities of the Council in sustaining and governing the Open Science Grid Consortium and its namesake project(s) and satellite projects. In particular make a proposal for how the responsibilities previously assigned to the Science Advisory group should be absorbed into the Council roles, responsibilities and authorities.
   * Clarify (if necessary) the roles and responsibilities  (including definition of length of service) of Council members.
   * Clarify (if necessary) the definition of Consortium membership as well as the roles and responsibilities that come with such membership.
   *  Clarify (if necessary) the definition interface between the Consortium, Council and sponsoring organizations.
   * Provide for adequate Council representation of Consortium members, contributors to, and users of the Open Science Grid.
 
The proposal may include suggested mechanisms for how the Council may wish to carry out its responsibilities and authorities and effect changes to the constitution and governance of the Open Science Grid.
 
Many, but not all, of the above issues are addressed in the existing OSG documents (Charter, By-Laws, Administrative procedures and other definition documents).  On acceptance of the proposal by the Council at large those documents will need to be updated as necessary to reflect the agreed changes.
